# Multi-stage build:
#   builder       — installs deps, compiles TS handlers, builds Vite frontend
#   runtime-deps  — installs only packages needed by unbundled raw JS handlers
#   final         — nginx (static) + node (API) under supervisord

# The crawlable-corpus step runs the source-attribution drift gate against
# scripts/, server/, api/, and src/. generate-inventory-facts and
# build-handlers write untracked .js into those same roots, so the gate must
# run on the pristine checkout first (#7435). tsc + vite stay later: they
# need the generated inventory assets and compiled handlers.

# Generated inventory modules are intentionally untracked. Recreate them in
# the clean image context before handlers import or bundle them.

# public/pro/ is a build product, not committed bytes (#6898), so this image has
# to build it. Skipping it does NOT 404: this image installs docker/nginx.conf,
# whose `location /` ends in `try_files $uri $uri/ /dashboard.html`,
# so /pro would quietly serve the dashboard SPA shell with a 200 — wrong content
# under a real URL, which is worse than a missing page. (docker/Dockerfile is the
# one with an explicit `location ^~ /pro` block, in nginx.conf.template.)
# build:pro installs pro-test's own lockfile.
RUN npm run build:pro

# Build the Vite frontend (outputs to dist/)
# Skip blog build — blog-site has its own deps not installed here
RUN npx tsc && npx vite build
# Assert the /pro pages survived the public/ -> dist/ copy (#6898). build:pro
# succeeding proves public/pro/ exists; it does NOT prove Vite copied it, and
# docker/nginx.conf's SPA fallback would serve the dashboard shell at 200 for a
# missing /pro rather than failing visibly.
