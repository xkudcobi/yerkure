# Analytics Collector Operations

World Monitor sends product analytics to the separately deployed Railway
`umami` service. Railway deployment status is not an application write-path
health signal: a healthy deployment can still return HTTP 500 from `POST
/api/send`.

## Write-path contract

- The Umami service must run the WorldMonitor-managed image built by
  [`Dockerfile.umami`](../Dockerfile.umami), or another immutable image proven
  to contain both the composite `(session_id, data_key)` unique index and the
  `ON CONFLICT` upsert for `session_data`. A version label alone is
  insufficient; verify the deployed image digest and schema/index.
- The scheduled write canary sends 12 attempts per run: three synchronized
  bursts of a pageview, a named event, and two concurrent `identify` writes
  sharing one session-data key.
- Every attempt must return a real Umami receipt (`cache`, `sessionId`, and
  `visitId`). Any failed attempt, including `P2002/session_data_pkey`, fails the
  monitor. A green heartbeat or a green Railway deployment does not override a
  red write canary.
- Acceptance after a server upgrade is two consecutive scheduled runs with
  `12/12` accepted writes and zero `P2002` failures. Attach the exact deployed
  image/digest and the bounded production log query to the issue.
- During normal queue draining, browser writes are serialized through one
  in-flight transport slot. `pagehide` with `persisted === false` (a real
  navigation) dispatches queued writes concurrently so keepalive delivery gets
  a chance to finish. `pagehide` with `persisted === true` is bfcache freeze,
  not unload: keep the hold. A tab that is only hidden (`visibilitychange` →
  `hidden`, including iOS/Safari backgrounding) does **not** flush: WebKit
  freezes in-flight `fetch`, and treating that as unload produced the
  WORLDMONITOR-ZF `timeout+raced` population (~27/day, 71% Apple). Hidden tabs
  hold the serialized queue and pause the module-owned latch until the page is
  visible again (`visibilitychange` or `pageshow`). The client does not blindly
  retry append-only conversion events after an ambiguous 5xx; identity snapshots
  may use their idempotent retry policy.

### Raced-timeout retry / replay (#6968)

A `raced` failure means the transport ignored our abort and the request may
still commit. That is the same "committed, then we stopped listening" ambiguity
that already forbids retrying a 500 or a gateway status:

| Door | Append-only event (conversion) | Identity snapshot |
|---|---|---|
| In-page retry (`isRetryableCollectorFailure` / `isRetryableIdentityFailure`) | closed | open (idempotent overwrite) |
| Durable checkout-marker replay (`isDurableMarkerResolved`) | closed (marker settles) | n/a |

`sendBeacon` is not a recovery path for conversions: it has no receipt, so a
successful beacon cannot clear a durable marker and a failed one cannot prove
the write never landed. Hidden-tab **hold** is the recovery: those writes never
become `raced`. Remaining `raced` events are parked wrappers on a visible tab
and stay unreplayable. Each Sentry payload carries `visibilityAtSend`,
`elapsedAtDeadlineMs`, `racedCount`, and `writeCount` so ZF is judged as a rate
against that page's writes, not as a raw daily count.

## Patched runtime image

Upstream Umami v3.2.0 still contains the
`updateMany()`/`create()` race from upstream issue `umami-software/umami#4183`.
The upstream repair landed after that release. `Dockerfile.umami` therefore
builds the exact v3.2.0 release commit
`2f6e2b5ff256862a081d9e74bed18a42ebf795e3` and applies only the source,
schema, migration, and regression test from upstream fix commit
`7c030e4c5da4b5fdf3e75e80787a0344b040ac8a`.

The image build fails if the patch no longer applies and runs the upstream
`saveSessionData` regression test before building the application. OCI labels
record both commits. The upstream migration was numbered `23` on its `dev`
branch; the overlay uses `21_update_session_data` because v3.2.0 ends at
migration `20`.

Railway watch paths for `umami` are the shared build-context policy, the image
definition, and the repository files that it copies: `.dockerignore`,
`Dockerfile.umami`, and the exact inputs under `docker/umami/`. Other
repository changes do not affect this upstream-based image and must not make
deploy-drift checks report it as behind.

Deploy the image only through this sequence:

1. Take a restorable backup of the production `Postgres Umami` service and
   record its backup ID and completion time. Do not rely on volume capacity or
   deployment status as backup proof.
2. Restore that backup into a disposable database on comparable hardware and
   rehearse migration `21_update_session_data` there. Record the table size,
   duplicate count, migration duration, peak database CPU, and lock waits. The
   rehearsal must finish in under 30 minutes, leaving headroom below the
   migration's 45-minute per-statement timeout. If it does not, stop and design
   a longer offline migration window instead of raising the production timeout
   during the rollout.
3. Measure and record the production duplicate set before migration:

   ```sql
   SELECT count(*) - count(DISTINCT (session_id, data_key)) AS duplicate_rows
   FROM session_data;
   ```

4. Close public ingress, disable every Umami cron or operator task that can
   write analytics, and scale the old collector to **zero** replicas. One
   replica is still a live writer and is not sufficient. Sample the following
   query twice at least 60 seconds apart; proceed only when both samples report
   zero active client transactions and identical mutation counters for
   `session_data` and `website_event`:

   ```sql
   SELECT
     (SELECT count(*)
      FROM pg_stat_activity
      WHERE datname = current_database()
        AND pid <> pg_backend_pid()
        AND backend_type = 'client backend'
        AND (state <> 'idle' OR xact_start IS NOT NULL)) AS active_clients,
     relname,
     n_tup_ins,
     n_tup_upd,
     n_tup_del
   FROM pg_stat_user_tables
   WHERE relname IN ('session_data', 'website_event')
   ORDER BY relname;
   ```

   Treat a missing table row, a changed counter, or any active client as a
   failed drain. Do not start migration while the result is ambiguous.
5. Build `Dockerfile.umami`, record the candidate image digest and both OCI
   commit labels, then run that exact digest as a separately monitored one-off
   with the normal application command overridden to:

   ```bash
   pnpm exec prisma migrate deploy
   ```

   Give the one-off only `DATABASE_URL`, keep the collector at zero replicas,
   and require a zero exit status. Migration `21` wraps the unchanged upstream
   dedupe and unique-index statements in one transaction, with a 5-second lock
   timeout and a 45-minute per-statement timeout. Lock contention or timeout
   therefore aborts and rolls back the dedupe and index together.
6. Before starting any collector process, require all three database checks to
   pass: no duplicate composite keys, exactly one valid/ready unique index, and
   one successful, non-rolled-back Prisma migration record.

   ```sql
   SELECT count(*) - count(DISTINCT (session_id, data_key)) AS duplicate_rows
   FROM session_data;

   SELECT
     indexrelid::regclass::text AS index_name,
     indisunique,
     indisvalid,
     indisready,
     pg_get_indexdef(indexrelid) AS index_definition
   FROM pg_index
   WHERE indrelid = 'public.session_data'::regclass
     AND indexrelid =
       'public.session_data_session_id_data_key_key'::regclass;

   SELECT
     migration_name,
     finished_at,
     rolled_back_at,
     applied_steps_count
   FROM "_prisma_migrations"
   WHERE migration_name = '21_update_session_data';
   ```

   `duplicate_rows` must be `0`; the index query must return exactly one row
   with all three boolean fields true and the expected `(session_id, data_key)`
   definition; the migration query must return exactly one row with
   `finished_at` set, `rolled_back_at` null, and `applied_steps_count > 0`.
7. Configure the Railway `umami` service to build from the repository root
   with `/Dockerfile.umami`, preserving its existing `APP_SECRET`,
   `DATABASE_URL`, domain, health check, restart policy, CPU/memory limits, and
   `NODE_OPTIONS`. Start the patched service at one replica while public ingress
   remains closed. Verify the running image digest and OCI labels match the
   one-off, and verify its startup migration is a no-op against the already
   recorded migration.
8. Run an internal heartbeat and one write-canary burst against the patched
   service. Reopen public ingress only after those probes pass and the three
   database checks above still pass.
9. Require two consecutive scheduled write-canary runs with `12/12` accepted
   writes, a bounded production log query with zero `P2002` or
   `session_data_pkey` failures, and advancing `website_event.created_at`.
10. Keep production acceptance open until memory remains bounded through a
    comparable traffic window (at least 40,000 events/hour, the observed
    #6024 trigger region). A quiet-hour smoke test proves correctness, not load
    acceptance.

If the one-off exits non-zero, times out, or loses its database connection,
keep ingress closed and the collector at zero replicas. Capture the one-off
logs, then inspect the duplicate, index, and `_prisma_migrations` checks above;
do not blindly rerun or start either application image. Because the migration
is transactional, a normal SQL failure rolls back both data deletion and index
creation. After correcting the cause, mark the failed Prisma record rolled back
with the candidate image's `pnpm exec prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back
21_update_session_data`, rerun the same one-off digest, and repeat all three
checks. If database state is inconsistent or transaction outcome is unknown,
restore the recorded backup before retrying.

If the migration succeeds but the patched service fails its internal gate,
leave ingress closed and repair or roll back the application deployment. The
composite index is compatible with the old image, but the old update/create
path can still race; starting the old image is emergency containment, not
remediation. Restoring deleted duplicate rows or recovering from uncertain
schema state requires the recorded database backup.

## Retention contract

**The horizon is 30 days.** It is declared once, at the top of
[`scripts/umami-retention.sql`](../scripts/umami-retention.sql), and every
statement reads that declaration — the tables must never carry their own
interval literal.

> **Take a backup before merging any change to `retention_horizon`.** Shortening
> the horizon is irreversible and it ships itself: `scripts/umami-retention.sql`
> is a watched path for the `umami-retention` service
> (`scripts/railway-services.json`), `railway-deploy-trigger.yml` redeploys
> watched-path services automatically once main goes green, and the next cron
> tick lands within 15 minutes. There is no review step between the merge button
> and the first bulk delete.
>
> Railway does **not** back this volume up for you — checked 2026-08-10, the
> `Postgres Umami` volume instance has an **empty backup schedule** and only
> two ad-hoc backups (2026-08-02, 2026-08-04). Assume no restore point exists
> unless you just made one.
>
> So, in order: take a fresh backup of the `Postgres Umami` volume, record its
> ID in the PR description, and only then merge. Lengthening the horizon needs
> no backup — it deletes strictly less.

30 days is a capacity number, not a preference. Size any future change the same
way, from measured bytes per retained day rather than from how much history
feels nice to keep:

| Input | Measured 2026-08-10 |
| --- | --- |
| `website_event` intake | ~450,000 rows/day |
| `website_event` bytes/row | ~1,700 B (heap **plus** the 15 indexes Umami creates; indexes are 18 GB of its 27 GB) |
| `event_data` intake | ~250,000 rows/day |
| `event_data` bytes/row | ~460 B |
| **Cost per retained day** | **~0.9 GB** |
| Railway volume | 50 GB |

At ~0.9 GB/day a 30-day window settles near 27 GB of **logical** data, or 54 %
of the volume. The 90-day window this file used until #6375 needed about 79 GB
and could never fit; the volume was projected full in 27.7 days. Grow the volume
before growing the horizon, and re-measure both intake and bytes/row first —
bytes/row is dominated by Umami's index set, so it moves whenever the schema
does.

**Expect the volume reading to plateau, not to fall.** `DELETE` marks tuples
dead; autovacuum makes that space reusable *inside* the relation but does not
return it to the filesystem. So the success signal after a horizon cut is that
`currentSizeMB` stops climbing while the logical size drops — not that the
number goes down. The monitor is built for this: growth at or below zero makes
projected headroom infinite, and 68.9 % usage is well under the 80 % warning.
If you ever need the space back for real, that is a separate, scheduled
`pg_repack` on `website_event` (its 18 GB of indexes is where the bloat sits),
not something this job can do.

A controlled maintenance process runs the file once per tick; no statement
loops inside one invocation. Each delete is capped at 10,000 rows,
session-replay payloads are capped at 64 MiB per invocation, and oversized
replay rows are left for operator handling rather than force-deleted. Child
rows are deleted before parent rows. The job must not use `TRUNCATE` or an
unbounded `DELETE`.

**Each delete commits in its own transaction.** One transaction around all of
them is what made #6375 silent: the 2026-08-10 12:22 tick logged `DELETE 1369`,
then the next statement hit the timeout, and `ON_ERROR_STOP` rolled *both* away.
Ordering still runs children before parents, so an aborted tick can only leave
the database further along, never inconsistent. The cost is a brief window in
which an event's `event_data` is gone while the event row survives to the next
tick; those rows are already past the horizon and are not in any report.

**The advisory lock is session-scoped and taken with `pg_try_advisory_lock`.**
It has to outlive a single transaction now, and an overlapping tick must exit 0
with a message rather than block into `lock_timeout` and crash. A tick that
skips is a normal outcome; a tick that crashes is the alarm.

**`statement_timeout` is 300s, sized against measurement.** One 10,000-row
`website_event` batch costs 15.0s against a warm cache — 14.7s of that is the
delete's own 10,000 primary-key probes at ~1.5 ms each — and roughly four times
that when the pages are cold. The previous 60s sat *inside* that range, so the
tick died on the cold half. Re-measure with `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` inside
a transaction you `ROLLBACK` before changing either the batch size or this
number.

Note that Umami declares its relations in Prisma but creates **no foreign keys**
in Postgres, so nothing in the database enforces child-before-parent. The
`NOT EXISTS` guard on the parent delete is the only thing that does.

The `event_data` delete is bounded by its **own** `created_at`, not by a join to
the parent event — the join had to scan all 2.4 M eligible parents to find the
few thousand that still had children. The two clocks were measured equal, not
assumed: across 1,027,145 pairs in two disjoint bands, min and max skew were
both `00:00:00` and zero rows differed. Re-run that comparison before widening
the predicate:

```sql
SELECT count(*), min(d.created_at - e.created_at), max(d.created_at - e.created_at),
       count(*) FILTER (WHERE d.created_at <> e.created_at) AS differing
FROM event_data d JOIN website_event e ON e.event_id = d.website_event_id
WHERE d.created_at >= now() - interval '3 days';
```

### After a horizon change ships

The runner alarm only proves the tick did not crash. It cannot tell you the tick
retired the *right* rows. Run this read-only query after the first few ticks, and
again a day later — `over_horizon` must fall monotonically toward zero, and
`oldest` must walk forward:

```sql
SELECT 'website_event' AS table_name, min(created_at) AS oldest, max(created_at) AS newest,
       count(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at < now() - interval '30 days') AS over_horizon
FROM website_event
UNION ALL
SELECT 'event_data', min(created_at), max(created_at),
       count(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at < now() - interval '30 days')
FROM event_data;
```

A frozen `oldest` with a non-zero `over_horizon` across several ticks is the
#6375 signature — the tick is running but committing nothing. Read the active
deployment's runtime logs next, not its status.

The contract preserves website configuration and saved replay definitions.
Before enabling the job, take a database backup and verify the table names
against the deployed Umami schema. The SQL is intentionally not called by the
browser, the Vercel API, or the storage monitor.

`psql` substitutes a variable only **outside** quotes. `interval :'retention_horizon'`
expands in a plain statement, but the identical text inside the dollar-quoted
body of a `DO` block reaches the server verbatim and fails with
`syntax error at or near ":"`. The two `DO` blocks therefore read
`current_setting('worldmonitor.umami_retention_horizon')`, which is set from the
same single declaration.

## Retention runner

`Dockerfile.umami-retention` packages only a digest-pinned PostgreSQL client and
the reviewed retention SQL. Its registry lifecycle is active, so Railway runs it
at minutes 7, 22, 37, and 52 of each hour. Four bounded 10,000-row batches per
hour can retire up to 960,000 eligible event rows per day. A once-daily
10,000-row tick would run successfully while permanently falling behind, so it
is not an acceptable schedule.

Size the schedule against the rate rows **cross** the horizon, not against
intake. Those are different numbers whenever traffic is growing: when retention
was activated (#6148) the collector took 591,244 events/day while only
134,653/day aged past the then-90-day boundary, because the boundary was still
sweeping through much quieter traffic from three months earlier. Intake is the
figure that matters for the steady state — once the boundary reaches present-day
volume, eligibility converges on it, and 960,000/day has to stay above it. At
the 2026-08-10 intake of ~450,000 events/day that leaves 2.1x of headroom.

Provision the Railway `umami-retention` service from the repository root with
`/Dockerfile.umami-retention`. Configure `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGDATABASE`,
`PGUSER`, and `PGPASSWORD` as private variable references to `Postgres Umami`;
do not use its public TCP URL. The image defaults `PGCONNECT_TIMEOUT` to 10
seconds so a blackholed database connection exits within a bounded interval;
Railway may override it with another positive integer when operations require a
different connection budget. This timeout covers connection establishment;
the SQL file's transaction and statement timeouts cover work after connection.
The image invokes `psql -X` with `ON_ERROR_STOP=1`, so a missing connection
variable, connection timeout, or any SQL failure exits the cron non-zero.

The registry marks this service `lifecycle: active`, so the live Railway audit
requires it to exist and reconciles its cron. It was `planned` until #6148: a
planned entry stays subject to the static Dockerfile and registry checks while
the live audit neither requires the service nor reconciles its schedule, which
is what lets the service be provisioned and manually gated before activation.
Keep that order for any future runner — provision and complete the manual tick
while planned, and only set `lifecycle: active` in a separate reviewed change
once the runtime migration, write canary, and manual retention gate are green.

Before enabling the recurring schedule, run one manual tick after the backup
and record its duration, deleted-row counts, database CPU, and lock waits. Then
enable `7,22,37,52 * * * *` and observe at least four consecutive ticks. Stop
the cron if lock waits or collector latency rise; already completed bounded
deletes remain committed, and no further rows are touched while the cron is
disabled.

Two Railway mechanics decide whether that schedule is really running, and both
fail quietly:

- **The cron scheduler reads the active deployment's manifest, not the service
  config.** A `serviceInstanceUpdate` that sets `cronSchedule` returns success
  and reads back correctly from `railway environment config` while the
  deployment keeps firing on its old schedule. Redeploy after changing it, then
  confirm the schedule on the *deployment* manifest rather than the service.
- **A cron tick does not create a deployment record.** It re-runs the active
  deployment, so a tick is visible in that deployment's runtime logs and in the
  data — never as a new row in the deployments list.
- **A failing tick is invisible in every fleet audit.**
  `scripts/railway-deployments.mjs` counts `CRASHED` as a *running* status,
  which is correct for a source-drift audit — the image did run — and means the
  drift reconciler reports this service healthy while every tick exits non-zero.
  The runner alarm below exists for exactly that gap. Read the runtime logs of
  the active deployment, not its status, when you want to know what a tick did.

To read what the last tick actually did:

```
railway deployment list --project "$RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID" --environment production \
  --service umami-retention --limit 1000 --json
```

Every push to `main` writes a `SKIPPED` refusal ("No changes to watched files")
for this service, and those arrive far faster than 4 ticks/hour — so the newest
record is almost never the tick. Take the newest record whose status is a
*running* one, then read that deployment's logs. A healthy tick logs `BEGIN`,
`DELETE <n>`, `COMMIT` per statement; a locked-out tick logs the skip message
and exits 0.

### `HISTORY_WINDOW_SATURATED` — the runner is invisible, not dead

If the alarm reports this verdict, **check the tick logs before touching
Postgres.** Refusals accrued at ~29.5/day through August, so a window of N
records only reaches back N/29.5 days. On 2026-08-22 the active deployment was
5.5 days old and healthy — 71 of 71 scheduled ticks fired, zero errors — but sat
at index 206 behind 206 refusals, so a 200-record window could not see it and
the alarm read as if retention had died.

`--limit 1000` (the CLI maximum) buys ~34 days. When even that saturates, the
deciding record is *older than the window*, not missing:

```
# authoritative pointer to the active deployment, immune to refusal depth
railway logs --project "$RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID" --environment production \
  --service umami-retention
```

A redeploy also clears it by minting a fresh record at index 0. The Railway
GraphQL field `serviceInstance.latestDeployment` names the active deployment
directly and would remove this depth limit permanently; the CLI exposes no
equivalent (`railway status --json` returns only `{id, name}` per service).

The runtime-image migration and the retention runner are separate gates. Do
not start retention until the composite-index migration has succeeded and the
write canary is green.

## Capacity alert

`.github/workflows/umami-storage-monitor.yml` reads the Railway volume list
without mutating Railway or Postgres. It keeps the last 3 days of samples and
reports the following capacity conditions:

- current usage is at least 80% (warning) or 90% (critical); or
- projected days to full are at most 30 (warning) or 14 (critical), once the
  samples span at least 2 days.

Growth is a least-squares fit over those 3 days, not the difference from one
old sample. Railway refreshes `currentSizeMB` only about every 6 hours, so the
samples form a staircase. On 2026-09-13, one +1,078 MB refresh measured against
a 24-hour baseline projected 8 days of headroom and failed the workflow, while
the 3-day trend gave 17 days.

The history is carried between runs as the `umami-storage-state` workflow
artifact, not as an Actions cache entry. The repository cache sits at its 10 GB
limit, and GitHub evicted every cached copy of the history on 2026-09-12, so the
trend kept starting over. Each run restores the newest artifact from this
workflow's recent runs on the same branch. When none exists, the run warns and
starts a new trend.

A warning emits a GitHub annotation but leaves the scheduled workflow green so
the 15-minute probe does not send repeated failed-run alerts during a bounded
retention drain. A critical condition fails the workflow. Input, Railway, or
state-processing errors also fail closed.

## Retention runner alarm

Volume usage is a *lagging* signal. In #6375 the runner exited non-zero on every
tick for days while the volume took its time drifting into the warning band —
and that warning is deliberately non-fatal, so nothing ever failed. The same
workflow therefore also runs
[`scripts/check-umami-retention-runner.mjs`](../scripts/check-umami-retention-runner.mjs),
which reads deployment records only — never Postgres — and fails when the newest
`umami-retention` deployment **that actually ran** is `CRASHED`.

Two details carry the whole check:

- It selects the newest record in a *running* status, not `deployments[0]`.
  Reading index 0 returns a push refusal almost every time and would have missed
  the outage completely.
- It fails closed on an empty history, an unreadable payload, a history with no
  running record, and any Railway status this repo does not model. An unmodelled
  status is alarming rather than skipped, because `newestRunning()` would
  otherwise step past it onto an older, healthier record.

The step carries `if: ${{ !cancelled() }}` and runs last. Last, so a critical
capacity failure cannot stop the capacity step from writing its growth-baseline
sample; unconditional, so that same failure cannot stop the one actionable alarm
from printing. Capacity is the symptom, the runner is the cause, and the fix
starts from the cause.

The monitor prints only volume size, growth, and projected headroom. It never
prints Railway variables, database URLs, analytics payloads, or user identity
fields.
