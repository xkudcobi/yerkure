# World Monitor: Press Kit & FAQ

## What Is World Monitor?

World Monitor is a real-time global intelligence dashboard that brings together news, markets, military activity, infrastructure data, and AI-powered analysis into a single, interactive map interface. Think of it as a situational awareness tool that was previously only available to government agencies and large corporations with six-figure OSINT budgets, now accessible to journalists, analysts, researchers, and curious citizens through a web browser or desktop app.

The platform provides global coverage through curated news feeds, live news streams, satellite tracking, military flight and naval vessel data, prediction markets, and a registry-backed layer catalog. All of this is visualized on either a photorealistic 3D globe or a flat WebGL map, with AI summarization that distills large headline volumes into actionable intelligence briefs.

## How Does It Work?

### The Core Experience

When a user opens World Monitor, they see a globe (or flat map) populated with live data points. Each point represents something happening in the world right now: a military flight over the Black Sea, an earthquake in Turkey, a protest in Nairobi, a cyberattack origin in Eastern Europe, or a spike in GPS jamming near a conflict zone.

Users can toggle the registered map layer types on and off, zoom into regions, click on any event for details, and read AI-generated summaries that connect dots across multiple data streams. A command palette (Cmd+K) provides instant search across countries, layers, and intelligence categories.

### Specialized Dashboards

World Monitor runs named thematic variants from a single codebase, each tailored to a different audience:

| Variant | Domain | Focus |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **World Monitor** | worldmonitor.app | Geopolitics, military, conflicts, infrastructure |
| **Tech Monitor** | tech.worldmonitor.app | AI/ML, startups, cybersecurity, tech ecosystems |
| **Finance Monitor** | finance.worldmonitor.app | Markets, central banks, Gulf FDI, commodities |
| **Commodity Monitor** | commodity.worldmonitor.app | Mining, metals, energy, critical minerals |
| **Happy Monitor** | happy.worldmonitor.app | Good news, conservation, positive global trends |
| **Energy Monitor** | energy.worldmonitor.app | Energy security, oil and gas, chokepoints, policy response |

### AI Intelligence Layer

World Monitor uses a multi-tier AI pipeline to process and summarize information:

1. **World Brief**: An AI-generated summary of the most significant global events, updated regularly, using a chain of language models that prioritizes speed and cost efficiency.
2. **AI Deduction**: Users can ask free-text geopolitical questions (e.g., "What are the implications of rising tensions in the South China Sea?") and receive analysis grounded in live headlines.
3. **Headline Memory**: The system maintains a local semantic index of recent headlines, allowing it to recall and correlate events across time.
4. **Threat Classification**: A three-stage pipeline automatically categorizes incoming news by severity and type.
5. **Country Intelligence Briefs**: Full-page dossiers for any country, combining instability scores, AI analysis, event timelines, and prediction market data.

Browser-side ML features can run locally using lightweight models, with no data leaving the user's device. Server-authoritative APIs publish CII/CRI scores, briefs, forecasts, MCP tools, and cached operational data; cloud AI providers such as Groq and OpenRouter are used only for the features that explicitly configure them.

## Scoring & Detection Systems

### Country Instability Index (CII)

The Country Instability Index publishes server-authoritative CII v8 stress
scores from 0 to 100 for 31 Tier-1 countries. The score is directional
situational awareness, not a prediction or a safety rating.

- **Event score**: `unrest * 0.25 + conflict * 0.30 + security * 0.20 + information * 0.25`
- **Headline score**: `baselineRisk * 0.4 + eventScore * 0.6`, then capped boosts and floors for climate, cyber, wildfires, advisories, OREF, displacement, news urgency, earthquakes, sanctions, AIS disruptions, UCDP conflict class, and State Department advisory level
- **Provenance**: every score exposes `methodology_version`, component values, advisory provenance (`live`, `fallback`, or `absent`), and a signed 24-hour movement delta

Scores are classified as: Low (0-30), Normal (31-50), Elevated (51-65),
High (66-80), Critical (81-100). The full public methodology is
`/docs/methodology/cii-risk-scores`.

### Country Resilience Index (CRI)

The Country Resilience Index scores the 196-country public rankable universe
from 0 to 100 across 72 indicators, 21 active dimensions, 6 domains, and 3 pillars. It uses
official and authoritative sources, transparent goalposts, coverage tracking,
and imputation taxonomy so analysts can see how much of each score is observed
versus imputed. CRI complements CII: CII measures near-term stress; CRI measures
shock-absorption and recovery capacity.

### Hotspot Detection

The system identifies emerging crises by blending news clustering, geographic convergence, CII scores, and military signal proximity. When multiple indicators converge in a region, the system elevates it as a "hotspot" with escalation scoring.

### Cross-Stream Correlation

14 signal types are monitored for unusual patterns: when a GPS jamming spike coincides with military flight activity near an active conflict zone, or when prediction market prices shift alongside breaking news from a specific region, the system flags these correlations for analyst attention.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is World Monitor free?**
A: Yes. The core dashboard with map layers, news feeds, live streams, and many AI features is free to use. Pro and API tiers add higher-value workflows, API keys, MCP access, and heavier operational use cases.

**Q: Where does World Monitor get its data?**
A: Exclusively from publicly available, open-source data. This includes government agencies (USGS, NASA, NOAA, EIA, FRED), academic institutions (ACLED, UCDP), open tracking networks (ADS-B, AIS), news RSS feeds, and public APIs. No classified or proprietary intelligence is used.

**Q: Is this legal?**
A: Yes. All data sources are publicly accessible and used within their terms of service. The platform aggregates open-source intelligence (OSINT), a well-established practice in journalism, academia, and security research.

**Q: How real-time is the data?**
A: Most data layers update every 1 to 15 minutes. Military flight and vessel tracking updates in near-real-time (seconds to minutes). News feeds are polled every 15 minutes. Prediction markets update every few minutes. Earthquake and disaster alerts propagate within minutes of occurrence.

**Q: Can I trust the AI analysis?**
A: The AI summarization and deduction features are tools, not oracles. They synthesize patterns from aggregated headlines and data, but should be treated as one input among many. All AI outputs cite their source headlines, allowing users to verify claims. The system is designed to surface signals, not make definitive predictions.

**Q: Does World Monitor track users or sell data?**
A: No. There are no tracking cookies, no user profiling, and no data sales. The free tier requires no account. AI features can run entirely in-browser with no data sent to external servers.

**Q: Is the code open source?**
A: Yes. World Monitor is licensed under AGPL-3.0, meaning anyone can inspect, audit, modify, and redistribute the code. If you run a modified version as a service, you must share your modifications under the same license.

**Q: Who built this?**
A: World Monitor was created by Elie Habib. It is an independent project, not affiliated with any government, intelligence agency, or defense contractor.

**Q: Can I embed World Monitor or use its data in my reporting?**
A: The web interface can be referenced and linked in reporting. For data integration, use the documented REST API, OpenAPI specs, or MCP server. Please attribute "World Monitor (worldmonitor.app)" when referencing the platform in published work.

**Q: How is this different from Janes, Palantir, or Dataminr?**
A: Those are enterprise products costing tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, typically sold to governments and large corporations. World Monitor aims to democratize access to situational awareness by aggregating public data and using AI to make it digestible. It is open source, free to use, and designed for individual analysts and small teams, not just large organizations.

**Q: What does "Country Instability Index" mean and how reliable is it?**
A: The CII is a documented composite stress score (0-100) for 31 Tier-1 countries. CII v8 combines baseline risk with unrest, conflict, security, information, and capped/floored live-signal terms, and emits methodology version plus provenance fields. It is not a predictive model and should not be used as the sole basis for security or investment decisions. It is most useful for identifying countries experiencing unusual activity relative to their baseline.

**Q: How many people work on this?**
A: World Monitor is primarily a solo project by its creator, with occasional open-source contributions from the community.
