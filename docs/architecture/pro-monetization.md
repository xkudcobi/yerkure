# Pro monetization — current architecture

**Last verified**: 2026-07-27 (public lifecycle, plan, price, and capability facts now share one generation chain).

Factual snapshot of the repository architecture for authentication, payments, entitlements, and billing management. Checkout source references were reviewed on 2026-09-15; deployment must be verified separately.

## Stack at a glance

| Concern | Provider | Primary entry points |
|---|---|---|
| Auth | **Clerk** (`@clerk/clerk-js` headless on main app, `@clerk/clerk-react` on `/pro`) | `src/services/clerk.ts`, `pro-test/src/services/checkout.ts` |
| Payments | **Dodo Payments** (top-level redirect to hosted checkout + guarded full-page return) | `convex/lib/dodo.ts`, `src/services/checkout.ts`, `pro-test/src/services/checkout.ts`; neither browser bundle requires the overlay SDK |
| Entitlements | **Convex** (`subscriptions` + `entitlements` tables, reactive WebSocket) | `convex/payments/*`, `src/services/entitlements.ts`, `src/services/billing.ts` |
| Referral attribution | **Dodo → Affonso** (via `metadata.affonso_referral` contract) | `convex/payments/checkout.ts:131`, `convex/payments/subscriptionHelpers.ts:299` |
| Billing portal | **Dodo customer portal** | `api/customer-portal.ts`, `convex/payments/billing.ts`, `src/services/billing.ts:openBillingPortal` |
| Gateway auth | Clerk bearer JWT + `validateBearerToken` | `server/auth-session.ts`, `api/create-checkout.ts` |

## Tier model

The authoritative lifecycle, plan, price, visibility, and checkout metadata lives in `convex/config/productCatalog.ts`. The MCP capability count comes from `api/mcp/registry/index.ts`. `npm run product:facts` combines those sources into committed Edge, Railway, static, structured-data, and agent-discovery artifacts; normal production build commands run it automatically. `npm run product:facts:check` is the non-mutating freshness gate.

Products are served at runtime from `https://api.worldmonitor.app/api/product-catalog`; generated client configuration lives in `pro-test/src/generated/tiers.json`:

- **Free** — `price: 0`, no productId, card links to dashboard.
- **Pro Monthly** — `pdt_0Nbtt71uObulf7fGXhQup` ($39.99/mo).
- **Pro Annual** — `pdt_0NbttMIfjLWC10jHQWYgJ` ($399.99/yr, ~17% discount).
- **API Starter** — `pdt_0NbttVmG1SERrxhygbbUq` ($99.99/mo, 1k req/day).
- **API Annual** — `pdt_0Nbu2lawHYE3dv2THgSEV` ($999/yr).
- **API Business** — `pdt_0Nbttg7NuOJrhbyBGCius` ($299.99/mo, 10k req/day, commercial-use license + 5 bundled Pro seats (any corporate email domain); monthly-only, published in #4945; Starter→Business upgrades ride the Dodo collection/portal path).
- **Enterprise** — `mailto:enterprise@worldmonitor.app` (contact sales).

## Auth — Clerk

- **Init**: `src/services/clerk.ts` exposes `initClerk()`, `openSignIn()`, `signOut()`, `getClerkToken()` (50s cached, in-flight deduped, generation-guarded against account-switch races).
- **UserButton**: mounted by `src/components/AuthHeaderWidget.ts` when signed in; `"Sign In"` button when signed out.
- **JWT template**: `"convex"` preferred (carries `plan` claim for faster server checks); falls back to default session token.
- **`/pro` surface**: lazily loads `@clerk/clerk-js` via `pro-test/src/services/checkout.ts:ensureClerk()`, styled to match marketing page.
- **Desktop (Tauri)**: Clerk session token stored in macOS Keychain; deep-link callback wiring under `src-tauri/`.
- **Auth state**: `src/services/auth-state.ts` centralizes the current session; subscribers include billing watch, entitlement watch, referral service, auth header widget.

## Payments — Dodo

### Checkout creation

Two Convex actions at `convex/payments/checkout.ts`:

- `createCheckout` (public action): Convex/Clerk auth.
- `internalCreateCheckout` (internal action): called by `/relay/create-checkout` with trusted userId from the edge gateway.

Both share `_createCheckoutSession()` which:

1. Validates `returnUrl` against an allow-listed set of worldmonitor.app origins.
2. Builds metadata: `wm_user_id` (HMAC-signed via `convex/lib/identitySigning.ts`), `wm_login_email` + `wm_login_email_sig` (the Clerk login email authenticated for this checkout, signed as a **separate** field so the `wm_user_id_sig` payload stays `userId` alone and pre-existing sessions keep verifying), + optional `affonso_referral`.
3. Calls `checkout()` from `convex/lib/dodo.ts`.
4. Returns `{ checkout_url }` for hosted checkout navigation.

### Duplicate guard

Before creating a session, `getCheckoutBlockingSubscription` checks for active/on_hold/cancelled subs. If one exists, throws/returns `ACTIVE_SUBSCRIPTION_EXISTS` with the blocking plan info — clients route the user to billing portal instead of creating a second sub.

### Checkout flow

Both surfaces take the same path since #4449: a top-level redirect to Dodo's hosted checkout. The overlay iframe could not host Dodo's nested 3DS/fraud stack.

- **Live path**: `startCheckout()` (`src/services/checkout.ts`, `pro-test/src/services/checkout.ts`) creates the session at the edge endpoint, then navigates full-page. Dodo returns the buyer to the dashboard on the guarded `?wm_checkout=return` contract; `src/services/checkout-return.ts:handleCheckoutReturn()` reads the params, reconciles success only against authoritative Dodo evidence (`subscription_id`/`payment_id` plus a success status), and cleans the URL.
- **Overlay removed**: neither surface initializes the Dodo overlay SDK. The dashboard's unused overlay event handler, callback wiring, watchdog and SDK dependency have been removed. Hosted checkout uses `safeHostedCheckoutUrl()` before navigation; live entitlement subscriptions and the guarded return handler own activation.

### Webhook → subscription lifecycle

`convex/payments/subscriptionHelpers.ts` handles Dodo webhook events (`subscription.active`, `subscription.renewed`, `subscription.updated`, `payment.succeeded`, refunds). On first `subscription.active`, writes `subscriptions` row, recomputes `entitlements`, and credits referral attribution if `metadata.affonso_referral` matches a `userReferralCodes` row.

**Lifecycle-email recipient** (`subscription.active` only). Resolved in this order: the signed `wm_login_email` from checkout metadata, verified against the finally-resolved `userId` and aged against the event clock (`CHECKOUT_LOGIN_EMAIL_MAX_AGE_MS`, 7 days); then `users.email`; then the Dodo checkout email. The `users` row is only as fresh as the buyer's last page load for that userId, so a Clerk portal email change made in a long-lived tab leaves it stale — the stamped value is as fresh as the checkout itself. Every rejection at the first rung is a silent fall-through to the next, never a failure to send. The `customers` row keeps the checkout email regardless; it mirrors Dodo's record for portal lookups.

## Entitlements — Convex

- **Schema**: `subscriptions` (userId, planKey, status, currentPeriodEnd, dodoSubscriptionId) + `entitlements` (userId, tier, validUntil, derived from subscriptions).
- **Reactive watch**: `src/services/billing.ts:initSubscriptionWatch()` subscribes to `getSubscriptionForUser` over WebSocket. Updates fire within seconds of webhook processing.
- **Panel gating**: `src/services/entitlements.ts` exposes `isEntitled()`, `hasTier()`; `panel-layout.ts` reloads on free→pro transition so locked panels unlock without manual refresh.
- **Cache invalidation**: entitlement changes delete the Redis cache entry via Upstash REST API before the reload.

## Billing management

- **Entry point**: `UnifiedSettings.ts:450` renders a `<button class="manage-billing-btn">Manage Billing</button>` inside the settings modal.
- **Edge gateway**: `api/customer-portal.ts` validates Clerk bearer, relays to `/relay/customer-portal` on Convex, which calls Dodo to mint a user-scoped portal session.
- **Client-side**: `src/services/billing.ts:openBillingPortal()` fetches the portal URL via Convex action and opens in a new tab. Falls back to `https://customer.dodopayments.com` (generic portal) on any failure.
- **/pro parallel**: `pro-test/src/services/checkout.ts:openBillingPortal()` is triggered when a `/pro`-origin checkout hits `ACTIVE_SUBSCRIPTION_EXISTS`; currently redirects via `window.location.assign()` (same-tab).
- **Payment failures**: `src/components/payment-failure-banner.ts` renders a persistent red banner when subscription status is `on_hold`; auto-hides on return to `active`.

## Referral attribution

- **Code generation**: `/api/referral/me.ts` (edge, Clerk-auth'd) returns `{ code, shareUrl }` where `code` is a deterministic 8-char HMAC of the Clerk userId using `BRIEF_URL_SIGNING_SECRET`. Background binding into Convex via `ctx.waitUntil` — non-blocking on purpose (see module docstring for rationale).
- **Share link**: `https://worldmonitor.app/pro?ref=<code>`.
- **Attribution point**: recipient's checkout metadata carries `affonso_referral: <code>` (vendor contract — Dodo → Affonso referral tool; **do not rename**). On first `subscription.active` webhook, `subscriptionHelpers.ts:299` looks up the code in `userReferralCodes` and inserts a `userReferralCredits` row crediting the sharer.
- **Known gap**: referral code propagation from the dashboard-origin checkout path is incomplete.

## Security & auth surfaces

- **Edge endpoints** that accept Clerk JWTs must go through `validateBearerToken` (`server/auth-session.ts`). Applies to `/api/create-checkout`, `/api/customer-portal`, `/api/referral/me`.
- **Middleware UA guard** (`middleware.ts`): short-UA guard 403s non-browser fetches by default. New API endpoints called from Railway cron must be added to `PUBLIC_API_PATHS`.
- **Gateway premium check** (`server/gateway.ts`): accepts either Clerk `publicMetadata.plan === 'pro'` role OR Convex `entitlements.tier >= 1 && validUntil >= now`. Both signals must agree for a request to be treated as paid.
- **CORS**: Cloudflare Worker `api-cors-preflight` is the source of truth for `api.worldmonitor.app`. Overrides `api/_cors.js` + `vercel.json`. Worker source lives at [`workers/api-cors-preflight/`](https://github.com/koala73/worldmonitor/tree/main/workers/api-cors-preflight); it short-circuits OPTIONS preflight at the edge (skipping Vercel) and stamps CORS headers onto non-OPTIONS responses on the way back. Unit-tested in `workers/api-cors-preflight/index.test.mjs`, smoke-tested live in `tests/cors-preflight-live.test.mjs` (gated by `LIVE_SMOKE=1`), and deployed by `.github/workflows/deploy-worker.yml` on changes under `workers/api-cors-preflight/`. The Worker's allowlist + Allow-Headers list MUST stay a superset of `api/_cors.js#getCorsHeaders`; drift breaks credentialed CORS site-wide (2026-05-27 outage post-mortem).
- **HMAC identity bridge**: Dodo metadata `wm_user_id` is signed with a server-side key (`convex/lib/identitySigning.ts`) so webhooks can trust the user association without an additional lookup.
