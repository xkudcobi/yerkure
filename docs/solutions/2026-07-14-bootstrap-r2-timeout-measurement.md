# Bootstrap R2 timeout measurement

**Status:** CONCLUDED — **KTD7 NO-GO** (2026-07-24). R2-origin serving abandoned; the bootstrap-egress
objective is met instead by the KV storage-primitive path (see Verdict). Serving constants in
`api/_bootstrap-r2.js` remain `null` and Redis remains authoritative — production was never affected.

This was the evidence record for issue #5300 U3a (Vercel Edge → R2 serving). It never reached a go:
the calibration and validation gates below stayed blocked, and a 2026-07-24 review established that
the blocker is a **feasibility failure, not an incomplete measurement window**. The pending/zero
tables that follow are retained as the audit trail of *why* the gates never cleared.

## Verdict: KTD7 no-go

**The architecture cannot pass.** R2 is single-region (bucket in ENAM), so every far-region read is a
cross-planet round trip. Per the 2026-07-24 review analysis, using p95 as the conservative
mobile-tail overhead:

- Fast overhead 778 ms → `C_happy(fast)` = 1200 − 778 = **422 ms**. Even the best regions exceed at
  the maximum allowable timeout: `iad1` 34/1,326 = **2.56%**, `cle1` 36/1,302 = **2.76%** — against a
  required **≤0.2%**. Distant regions reach ~96%.
- Since every valid `T(fast)` must be ≤422 ms, no *smaller* timeout can improve that result, and more
  samples cannot repair a feasibility failure. This is the exact zero-savings-plus-added-latency
  outcome KTD7 exists to prevent.

**Independently verified 2026-07-24** (not from the review, checked against the tree/Axiom):
`BOOTSTRAP_R2_TIMEOUT_MS_FAST` and `_SLOW` are still `null`; `bootstrap_r2_shadow` spans 19 Vercel
execution regions; no regional cohort reached n ≥ 2,000; slow cohorts would take months at current
rates. The DebugBear-specific overhead figures above are the review's analysis and were not
independently re-derived here.

**Does not reopen #5300.** #5300 closed 2026-07-14 as complete — its accepted savings came from the
demand-driven / compaction work, not this experiment. The R2 sub-exploration (under #5338) is
abandoned, not a regression of #5300.

**Surviving path — the objective is still met.** The bootstrap-egress goal is pursued via the KV
storage-primitive cutover: a Cloudflare Worker serving from globally-replicated Workers KV (evidence:
`docs/solutions/2026-07-16-bootstrap-kv-verify.md`). KV reads are local-POP, avoiding the exact
single-region hop that sank R2 — measured at 99.6–99.7% of global reads under the 1200 ms budget vs
the incumbent's ~84%. KV serving remains flag-gated off; production still serves from Redis.

**Follow-up applied:** `DEBUGBEAR_RUM_SAMPLE_RATE` dropped 100 → 10 — full RUM sampling existed to
feed this measurement and had overrun the DebugBear monthly quota (~529k/500k).

_Historical record of the blocked gates (never cleared):_

## Instrumented contract

- `BOOTSTRAP_R2_SHADOW_MEASURE=1` is honored only when `VERCEL_ENV=production`.
- Public `fast` and `slow` origin requests still assemble and return Redis data.
- The R2 read runs only in `ctx.waitUntil` with the independent 5,000 ms probe ceiling.
- Axiom receives one exact-allowlist `bootstrap_r2_shadow` event with the shared
  `r2 | fallback` outcome vocabulary.
- The first shadow probe in an isolate is tagged cold; later probes are tagged warm.
- The response temporarily exposes its Redis duration and cache classifier headers for client RUM.
- Each shadow Redis pipeline appends one ignored marker read:
  `bootstrap:r2-shadow-origin-marker:<tier>`. MONITOR counts these markers instead of inferring
  origin traffic from the canonical tier pipeline, which the publisher now executes too.
- Client RUM chooses one tier per page and queues only three numeric DebugBear custom metrics
  (total, Redis, derived non-R2 overhead) plus three closed tags (tier, success/abort, mobile/desktop).
  It rejects missing, cached, conflicting, malformed, or impossible timing samples.

## Required setup before collection

1. Restore Railway CLI write authentication and create `publish-bootstrap-tiers` in production.
2. Install only the scoped publisher credentials in Railway and verify two successive advancing
   objects for both tiers. Set `IRAN_EVENTS_ENABLED` explicitly to the same value in Railway and
   Vercel so the publisher and serving registry cannot resolve different tier shapes.
3. Merge and deploy the disabled instrumentation.
4. In DebugBear RUM settings, map the currently unused custom slots:
   `metric1=bootstrap total`, `metric2=bootstrap Redis`, `metric3=bootstrap non-R2 overhead`,
   `tag1=bootstrap tier`, `tag2=bootstrap outcome`, and `tag3=device class`. Use a project with
   session tracking disabled (or disable it for this window) and record that setting below; the
   existing project currently reports sessions enabled, which would violate U3a's no-stable-ID
   evidence contract even though the six custom fields themselves contain no identifier.
5. Confirm `USAGE_TELEMETRY=1`, `AXIOM_API_TOKEN`, the scoped R2 read credentials, and the shared
   bucket routing values are present in Vercel production. Do not install them in preview.
6. Purge the two public bootstrap CDN objects, capture the first MISS and following HIT, and record
   the observed `Age`, `X-Vercel-Cache`, and `CF-Cache-Status` tuple below. The current classifier
   is a conservative candidate; no RUM sample is evidence until this production check passes.
7. Enable `BOOTSTRAP_R2_SHADOW_MEASURE=1` in Vercel production.

DebugBear documents five programmatic numeric metric slots and five string tag slots through its
snippet API. The public WorldMonitor snippet inspected on 2026-07-14 reported no configured custom
mappings. Adding the six bootstrap values does not add a request, user, or device ID to the
page-level custom fields. That is not sufficient by itself: the collector's project-level session
setting applies to the resulting page view. Record proof that sessions are disabled before treating
any sample as U3a evidence; otherwise use a dedicated privacy-minimal project or collector.

DebugBear session tracking disabled for the measurement window: **pending — blocked**.

## Controlled cache-classifier proof

| Check | Observed UTC | Age | X-Vercel-Cache | CF-Cache-Status | Result |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Purged origin MISS | pending | pending | pending | pending | blocked |
| Following cache HIT | pending | pending | pending | pending | blocked |

## Calibration

Minimum 2,000 observations per `(tier, execution region)`, spanning cold/warm execution and a full
daily traffic cycle.

| Tier | Region | Start/end UTC | n | Cold n | Warm n | Candidate T (ms) | C_happy (ms) |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| fast | pending | pending | 0 | 0 | 0 | pending | pending |
| slow | pending | pending | 0 | 0 | 0 | pending | pending |

## Independent validation

Freeze each candidate before this subsequent full-day window. Record the one-sided 95% binomial
upper confidence bound for `P(L > T)`; every cohort must be at most 0.2%.

| Tier | Region | Start/end UTC | n | Exceedances | 95% upper bound | Pass |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| fast | pending | pending | 0 | 0 | pending | blocked |
| slow | pending | pending | 0 | 0 | pending | blocked |

Formula/tool: pending.

## Denominator certification

Run Redis MONITOR over the exact Axiom window. Count the unique per-tier marker GETs and compare
them with `bootstrap_r2_shadow` events. Each tier must differ by no more than 1%, and every region
observed in production Vercel function logs must appear in Axiom.

| Tier | Start/end UTC | MONITOR markers | Axiom events | Difference | Pass |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| fast | pending | 0 | 0 | pending | blocked |
| slow | pending | 0 | 0 | pending | blocked |

## Resulting serving constants

| Constant | Value | Status |
|---|---:|---|
| `BOOTSTRAP_R2_TIMEOUT_MS_FAST` | `null` | blocked pending evidence |
| `BOOTSTRAP_R2_TIMEOUT_MS_SLOW` | `null` | blocked pending evidence |

Do not implement U4 while either value is `null` or any cohort, cache-classifier, or denominator
gate is incomplete.

## Disablement proof before U4

- `BOOTSTRAP_R2_SHADOW_MEASURE` disabled: pending.
- Both CDN objects purged after disablement: pending.
- Production responses contain no `Server-Timing: wm_bootstrap_redis`: pending.
- Temporary RUM no longer queues new samples: pending.
