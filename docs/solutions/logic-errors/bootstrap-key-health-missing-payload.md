# Bootstrap health reports missing compact projections as EMPTY

## Problem

[`/api/health`](../../../api/health.js) previously allowed every `EMPTY_DATA_OK` source to report `OK` when its `seed-meta` was fresh, even if its Redis payload was absent. That contract was too broad for compact bootstrap projections: a writer or transform failure could blank a user-facing panel while health remained green. The affected issue is [#5321](https://github.com/koala73/worldmonitor/issues/5321).

`api/health.js:710-725` puts both quiet metadata-only sources and bootstrap projections in `EMPTY_DATA_OK_KEYS`. Treating both categories alike erased the distinction between an expected quiet result and a missing required projection.

## Symptoms

- Health reported `OK` for a fresh bootstrap seed even though its data key was gone.
- Panels backed by compact projections could render empty without an actionable health signal.
- Operators could not distinguish a quiet successful source cycle from a missing projection payload.

## What Didn't Work

Making every `EMPTY_DATA_OK` key fail when the payload was missing would have fixed the projection blind spot, but it would also have broken normal quiet-source behavior. `weatherAlerts` and `newsThreatSummary` legitimately write fresh metadata without a payload after a successful quiet cycle; they must remain healthy in that state. CF Radar's `ddosAttacks` and `trafficAnomalies` now publish explicit payloads on confirmed-empty cycles. They remain in `EMPTY_DATA_OK_KEYS` for cold-start grace and are also in `MISSING_DATA_IS_FAILURE_KEYS` so fresh metadata cannot excuse a missing payload. `tests/health-empty-data-ok.test.mjs` covers this distinction.

CF Radar payload TTLs must exceed their health staleness thresholds, including the rounded-minute boundary. DDoS retains three hours and traffic anomalies two hours against a 60-minute gate. The optional DDoS target-location slice reports `targetLocationsDegraded: true` on its health entry when the producer marks it degraded; this diagnostic does not change status. Production acceptance for #7864 still requires paired payload and metadata observations over several natural publications, including a confirmed-empty cycle.

Earlier bootstrap work had correctly added compact dashboard-shaped side keys, but it also showed that a side key needs its own availability signal; healthy metadata alone cannot prove that a required projection is present (session history).

## Solution

Keep the broad `EMPTY_DATA_OK_KEYS` list, then add an explicit strict subset for projections that must have a payload:

```js
const MISSING_DATA_IS_FAILURE_KEYS = new Set([
  'thermalEscalationBootstrap',
  'ucdpEventsBootstrap',
  'wildfiresBootstrap',
  'forecastsBootstrap',
  'positiveGeoEvents',
]);
```

The set is defined at `api/health.js:727-737`. In the health evaluation, a strict key with fresh seed metadata and no data key now reports `EMPTY` before the general `EMPTY_DATA_OK` path runs. All other `EMPTY_DATA_OK` keys retain the prior `OK`-when-fresh and stale-status behavior (`api/health.js:926-933`).

## Why This Works

The check is narrow and expresses the real operational invariant: the five named projections represent expected bootstrap data, whereas the quiet sources represent an optional observation that may legitimately have no payload. Giving strict missing-payload detection precedence catches projection writer and transform failures without turning expected no-event cycles into false alarms. The exact source categorization is visible in `api/health.js:710-737`, and the two resulting contracts are exercised in `tests/health-empty-data-ok.test.mjs:16-92`: strict keys are expected to be `EMPTY`, while quiet keys are expected to be `OK`.

## Prevention

When adding a source to `EMPTY_DATA_OK_KEYS`, decide explicitly which contract it needs:

- Quiet or metadata-only sources may stay in the general list, where fresh metadata plus no payload is healthy.
- Bootstrap projections or other data-required outputs must also be added to `MISSING_DATA_IS_FAILURE_KEYS` so a missing fresh payload is visible as `EMPTY`.

Extend `tests/health-empty-data-ok.test.mjs` with both the intended strict and quiet expectation for any new category. This protects the distinction at the Vercel Edge health endpoint instead of relying on an implicit interpretation of `EMPTY_DATA_OK`.
