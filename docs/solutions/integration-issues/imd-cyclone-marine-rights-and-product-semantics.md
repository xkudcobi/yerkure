# Keep IMD cyclone and marine products typed, key-gated, and unflattened

## Problem

Issue #7005 adds India Meteorological Department cyclone tracks, forecast wind
radii, cones of uncertainty, port warnings, and sea-area / coastal bulletins.
Those products do not share one geometry or one all-clear meaning, and the
public API is account- and key-gated.

## What Didn't Work

- Merging IMD rows into `weather:alerts:v1`. That flattens a port signal, a
  textual marine bulletin, and a forecast cone into the same NWS/ECCC/SWIC
  alert card.
- Treating fishermen warning as live because the index lists `#api-23`. The
  public reference HTML has no field section (sections end at `#api-20`).
- Treating HTTP 401 or a quiet cyclone season as "no warning in India".

## Solution

- `scripts/lib/imd-cyclone-marine.mjs` qualifies each product, fail-closes
  undocumented fishermen warning, and keeps observed positions, forecast
  positions, forecast-wind-radii, and cone-of-uncertainty as distinct
  `geometryKind` values.
- Live fetch requires `IMD_API_KEY`, `IMD_API_EMAIL`, and
  `IMD_API_PASSWORD`. The seeder mints one short-lived JWT per run. Without
  valid credentials, it publishes `coverageState: disabled` or
  `unavailable` with `sourceState: unavailable` (not all-clear).
- One failed product carries last-good for that product only.
- Dashboard hydration is the on-demand bootstrap key `imdCycloneMarine`.

## Related Issues

- Fixes #7005.
- Does not implement #7004 (district/nowcast) or #7002 (NDMA SACHET).
