# An origin cache header proves nothing about the layer that honours it

## The recurrence

The crawlable corpus' `CDN-Cache-Control` header went silently inert **twice in
two days, from two different layers**, and `tests/deploy-config.test.mjs` was
green through both.

| | Layer that broke it | Why the offline assertion missed it |
|---|---|---|
| **#7590** (2026-09-03) | Vercel route matching. `vercel.json`'s `:param*` source compiles under path-to-regexp strict mode and never matches a trailing-slash URL — which is the only form the corpus serves. All ~22 corpus rules were inert. | The test modelled `:param*` as `(?:/.*)?`, which matches both forms. The model was more permissive than Vercel. |
| **#7659** (2026-09-04) | Cloudflare cache rules. A zone rule, "Bypass cache - WWW documents", sets `cache: false` for every extensionless/HTML path on `www`. A cache rule outranks origin cache headers, so the (now correctly delivered) header got no vote. | The test asserts what `vercel.json` declares. It cannot see a CDN that declined to honour it. |

Same header, same corpus, same green suite, two different downstream layers.
Fixing the first made the second visible — and the second had been true the
whole time.

## The convention

**A config assertion proves what you declared, never what a downstream layer
did with it.** Every hop between the config file and the user's browser can
independently nullify it:

```
vercel.json  ->  Vercel route matching  ->  Vercel edge cache  ->  Cloudflare cache rules  ->  browser
   (asserted offline)        #7590                                        #7659
```

So: any change whose *value* is delivered by a layer you do not control needs a
**live probe of the observable outcome**, not just an offline assertion of the
input. For caching that outcome is `cf-cache-status`, and its
`DYNAMIC` / `BYPASS` values are the precise fingerprint of "a rule declared this
ineligible before your header was read".

Note that a Vercel HIT is not evidence here. The corpus was *always*
`x-vercel-cache: HIT`; the live sweep's existing `isSharedCacheHit()` accepts a
Vercel HIT, which is exactly why it could not see this. Only `cf-cache-status`
distinguishes the two caches.

## What this looks like in the repo

- `scripts/cloudflare-cache-rule.mjs` generates the corrective Cloudflare rule
  from `CONTENT_CORPUS_PREFIXES` (and, since #7747, `EDGE_CACHED_FAMILIES` and
  `AGENT_TEXT_FILES`), so the CDN rule cannot drift from the `vercel.json`
  header rules it mirrors. `--check` compares it to the live zone;
  `--apply` reconciles it through the per-rule endpoints.
- `tests/cloudflare-cache-rule.test.mjs` pins the rule's shape offline **and**
  asserts it covers exactly the families `vercel.json` advertises — the drift
  that caused #7659.
- `tests/live-api-cache-auth-regression.test.mjs` carries the `corpus-edge-cache`
  probe: a real production document must reach a Cloudflare **HIT**, and its
  query-bearing form must stay uncached. This is the assertion neither incident
  had.
- `tests/deploy-config.test.mjs` still asserts the headers, with a comment
  naming both incidents so the next reader knows the assertion is necessary and
  not sufficient.

## Gotchas found while fixing it

- **Cloudflare's `status_code_ttl.value: 0` means `no-cache`, not "do not
  cache".** It *stores* the response and revalidates. Production showed a corpus
  404 sitting at `cf-cache-status: MISS` under `0`, i.e. stored. `-1` is
  `no-store`. This matters wherever a per-request-rendered non-2xx sits under a
  cached prefix — `middleware.ts`'s `originNotFoundResponse` negotiates on
  `Accept`, and Cloudflare honours `Vary` only for `Accept-Encoding`.
- **Cloudflare re-serialises `action_parameters` with keys sorted.** A drift
  check using `JSON.stringify` reports a false difference on a rule it just
  applied unchanged. Compare with a key-order-independent stringify.
- **The phase entrypoint `PUT` replaces every rule in the phase.** Use the
  per-rule endpoints instead: a read-modify-write of the whole ruleset silently
  reverts any concurrent dashboard edit, and round-trips other rules'
  user-owned `ref` values.
- **Changing the ruleset purges the edge cache.** Requests in the seconds after
  an `--apply` legitimately MISS repeatedly; size any retry loop for it.
- **`--apply` and a live probe are different guards.** `--check` catches config
  drift before it changes behaviour; the live probe catches behaviour whatever
  the config says. The probe is the one that would have caught both incidents.

## Third time: #7747 (2026-09-05)

The 582 sitemap URLs outside the corpus — `/docs/**`, `/blog/**`, the root
agent text files — were still DYNAMIC after #7659, and the issue read the gap
off a perfect correlation: every HIT carried `cdn-cache-control`, every DYNAMIC
did not. The correlation was real and the causal reading was wrong. Header and
Cloudflare rule were generated from the same prefix list, so every route had
both or neither; adding the header alone would have changed nothing, because
the bypass rule outranks it. The fix needed both halves again, and
`tests/cloudflare-cache-rule.test.mjs` now fails when they disagree.

What the widening surfaced:

- **One URL, several bodies.** Vercel answers `Accept: text/markdown` with a
  markdown rendering of any HTML document (corpus and blog, `Vary: accept`);
  Mintlify does the same for `text/markdown` and `text/plain`, serves an RSC
  flight for `RSC: 1` and the `next-router-*` headers, and both match media
  types case-insensitively. Cloudflare keys on the URL. The rule therefore
  admits an HTML document only when the request asks for it the way browsers
  and crawlers do — inspecting every `Accept` value, since the header may
  arrive as several lines and the origins honour the combined list — while
  `.md`/`.txt`/`.xml` files, which answer one body whatever is asked, are
  exempt so agents advertising their media type keep the cache. Negotiating
  requests for documents fall through to the bypass, exactly as before. Probe
  representations, not just routes, before caching anything behind a proxy.
- **Vercel's own cache is a third layer with the same problem.** For the
  Mintlify proxy `Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control: no-store` keeps Vercel from keying
  the HTML and markdown bodies under one URL while `CDN-Cache-Control` still
  gives Cloudflare its TTL.
- **Cloudflare fills an unset rule `ref` with the rule's id.** The first
  corpus rule was applied before the script set a `ref`, so the live `ref`
  echoed the `id`, and the identity check read that as a foreign ref on our
  description: `--check` said "ambiguous" against a zone holding exactly one
  copy. A description match whose `ref === id` is a legacy rule to adopt.
- **`curl -I` cannot see the rule.** It sends HEAD; the rule requires GET. A
  HEAD probe reports DYNAMIC on a route every real client gets as HIT. Verify
  with `curl -s -o /dev/null -D -`.

## Fourth time: #7804 (2026-09-06)

The corpus rule's representation guard was correct and inert on the two
busiest URLs on the site. A dashboard-managed sibling, `WWW entry HTML - use
origin CDN cache headers`, sat one position earlier and set `cache: true` for
any query-free `GET /` or `GET /dashboard` with no guard at all. Cloudflare
takes the last matching writer of a field, so a request the corpus rule
declined — `Accept: text/markdown`, which Vercel answers with a markdown
rendering of the homepage under the same cacheable header — still found
`cache: true` there. `--check` said "current" throughout: the managed rule
*was* current; the hole was in a rule the generator did not know existed.

What this adds to the convention:

- **A sibling rule with the same action and no guard reopens the hole.** The
  generator now owns the whole document surface (`ENTRY_DOCUMENTS` joined the
  model) and knows which rules it superseded (`RETIRED_CACHE_RULES`):
  `--check` reports one still in the zone as drift wherever it sits, and
  `--apply` deletes it after the claim lands.
- **Pin the invariant, not the two names that broke it.** The retired list
  names the rules that were wrong; a third dashboard rule under a fresh name
  would have slipped past it, which is the shape
  `pinned-value-allowlist-freezes-a-snapshot-not-the-invariant.md` warns
  about. So `--check` also scans structurally: any enabled earlier rule that
  sets `cache: true` and quotes a path the generator claims is reported, and
  it blocks `--apply` rather than being deleted — a name the generator does
  not know is a human's call. The claim set comes from the surface model, not
  from the generated expression, because the expression also quotes its own
  carve-outs (`/blog/_astro/`) and the zone's static-asset rule quotes that
  one legitimately.
- **A document that varies by User-Agent needs the UA in the guard.**
  `middleware.ts` routes the declared AI agents on `/` to `/home.md` under
  `Vary: User-Agent`, which Cloudflare ignores. The origin's `no-store` keeps
  that markdown out of the edge, but not the reverse: a crawler on a warm edge
  server was handed the stored browser HTML before middleware ran. The `/`
  claim carves those agents out; the corpus is UA-invariant and keeps them.
  The UA-keyed bypass `scripts/cloudflare-agent-readiness.mjs` used to append
  for the same purpose is gone — two scripts each insisting on the last
  position would have moved each other's rule on every run.
- **The safe probe for a representation is the query-bearing URL.** The rule
  requires an empty query, so `/?probe=1` with the suspect `Accept` or UA
  falls through to the bypass and shows the origin's answer without storing
  anything. Sending the suspect request to the bare URL *is* the poisoning.

## Fifth time: #7869 (2026-09-08) — a deferred half, pinned by a confident test name

The root sitemaps had been reported uncached in two consecutive audit rounds
before anyone looked at why. The reason turns out to be a new shape of this same
failure, and the most transferable one yet: **the incomplete half had been
written down as a decision.**

#7749 gave `/sitemap.xml` and `/sitemap-main.xml` the Vercel half of the pair and
stopped there, which is a defensible place to stop. What made it durable was the
test that pinned it:

```
it('caches root sitemaps at Vercel without changing the Cloudflare bypass (#7749)', ...)
```

— asserting `CDN-Cache-Control` was `null`. That test is green, confidently
named, and reads as a deliberate scope boundary rather than an unfinished job. So
nothing prompted anyone to finish it, and production kept answering
`cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC` until an external audit re-measured it two rounds
later. A TODO decays into a decision the moment it is expressed as a passing
assertion.

**The counter-practice, when a claim's other half lives outside the repo.** The
Cloudflare rule is only reachable through a manual `--apply`, so nothing in the
repo can prove it ran. Every in-repo guard here compares `vercel.json` against
`scripts/cloudflare-cache-rule.mjs` — two constants in the same tree, neither of
which knows what the zone contains. The fix is not a better offline assertion; it
is to put the URLs in the live post-deploy probe
(`tests/live-api-cache-auth-regression.test.mjs`), so *merged but never applied*
turns the sweep red instead of staying quietly inert. That workflow runs on
`deployment_status` and on a schedule, not on pull requests, so it cannot block
the merge — it reports afterwards, which is the correct shape for a claim that
only becomes true after an operator acts.

Both of these are the same lesson the rest of this document keeps arriving at,
one level up: **an assertion proves what was declared, and the thing worth
proving usually lives somewhere the assertion cannot see.** When it does, say so
in the test's name — a test called "…without changing the Cloudflare bypass"
should have been called "…pending the Cloudflare claim (#7749)".

### Two measurement traps, restated because both recurred here

- `curl -I` sends HEAD, and the rule's method guard excludes it, so HEAD reports
  `DYNAMIC` on routes that HIT for real clients. Every cache measurement in this
  repo must use GET. This is already recorded above and still produced a wrong
  round-6 measurement.
- The naive birthday figure is the wrong number for a namespaced key. Sizing the
  risk of a truncated-digest collision over 748 providers looked like ~1.65%
  until the namespace was read correctly: an anchor collision needs the slug to
  match *as well as* the digest, and every slug was distinct, so the path was
  unreachable rather than a one-in-sixty gamble. Overstating a risk buys the
  wrong fix; the defect there was a guarantee the code asserted and did not have.
