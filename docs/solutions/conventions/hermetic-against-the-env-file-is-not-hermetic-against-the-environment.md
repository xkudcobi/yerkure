## Context

Seeder modules call `loadEnvFile(import.meta.url)` at module scope, so importing one from a test used to hydrate `process.env` from the developer's `.env.local` — production Redis credentials included. `scripts/_seed-utils.mjs:284` closes that: `loadEnvFile` returns early when `isTestRuntime()` is true (`:234`, keyed on markers including `NODE_TEST_CONTEXT`, which both `node --test` and `tsx --test` set), unless `WM_ALLOW_ENV_LOAD_IN_TESTS=1`. `tests/seed-env-hermeticity.test.mjs` pins that and two sibling invariants.

The guarantee is precise, and its header comment says so: importing a seeder does not **load** a `.env` file. It is not a claim that a test process cannot see production credentials.

The difference bit twice in one session, in opposite directions:

1. First, asserting that importing the PortWatch seeder hydrates `PROXY_URL` from `.env.local`, and therefore that an uninjected proxy fallback in a test would make a real, billable Decodo request. Wrong — `loadEnvFile` is inert under the test runner.
2. Then, over-correcting into a code comment claiming the same path "fails closed with no proxy configured" under a test runtime, full stop. Also wrong — `resolveProxyStringConnect` reads `process.env.PROXY_URL` directly at call time (`scripts/_proxy-utils.cjs:100`). A developer with `PROXY_URL` exported in their shell, or CI with it set as a job variable, hands it straight to the seeder. The env file was never the only way in.

## Guidance

**A hermeticity guard covers the acquisition path it intercepts, and says nothing about the others.** `loadEnvFile` blocks file-sourced credentials. It cannot block ambient ones, because it is not in that path at all — the consumer reads `process.env` itself.

Before relying on such a guard, name the *specific* path it closes, then enumerate the other ways the same value arrives:

- the env file the guard intercepts,
- the ambient shell environment of whoever runs the suite,
- CI job/secret variables,
- a wrapper script or task runner that exports before invoking,
- a private copy of the loader that opted out (the third invariant in `tests/seed-env-hermeticity.test.mjs` exists precisely because a second copy of the loader once did).

**And enumerate the other *times* the value arrives.** A pin (or guard) applied at runtime reaches only call-time reads. A value captured at module load — `export const X = (process.env.X ?? 'default').toLowerCase() === 'true'` at a module's top level — has already consumed the ambient environment by the time any test `before()` hook or setup function runs, and is immutable for the process lifetime. Classify each env read's capture timing before claiming a pin covers it: per-call read → hook-time `process.env` writes work; module-load capture → import the exported binding and fail fast on an unexpected captured value. `RESILIENCE_SCHEMA_V2_ENABLED` in `server/worldmonitor/resilience/v1/_shared.ts` is exactly this shape, and a multi-perspective review pass in the authoring session still missed it until an adversarial reviewer reproduced the failure — see [cri-golden-baseline-env-pinning-trap](../test-failures/cri-golden-baseline-env-pinning-trap.md).

**When writing the claim into a comment, write the precondition with it.** "Fails closed under a test runtime" is the sentence that misleads. "Fails closed under a test runtime unless `PROXY_URL` is exported in the ambient environment, which `resolveProxyForConnect` reads directly" is the sentence that survives the next reader. A partial guarantee stated absolutely is worse than no comment, because it stops the reader from checking.

**The general shape:** a guard that makes something *usually* unreachable reads, to everyone downstream, as making it unreachable. The gap between "usually" and "always" is where the billable request, the production write, or the flaky test lives.

## Why This Matters

This class of error is self-reinforcing. The guard is real, the test that pins it is real, and both are cited in good faith — so the overstated conclusion inherits their credibility. Nothing in the guard's own test contradicts the wider claim, because the guard's test correctly scopes itself to the guard.

It also degrades quietly across environments. A conclusion that holds on CI (no `.env.local`, no exported `PROXY_URL`) fails on the one developer machine that exports it — the machine most likely to be running an ad-hoc test against a paid upstream.

## When to Apply

- A comment or doc is about to state that a code path is safe, inert, or fails closed under some condition.
- A test seam is added whose uninjected fallback would reach a real transport. Ask what happens when that leg is hit, and under whose environment.
- A guard's name generalizes further than its implementation (`isTestRuntime`, `hermetic`, `safe`, `isolated`) — read the implementation for the path it actually intercepts.
- Any secret or endpoint config reachable through more than one mechanism.

## Examples

**The narrow, true claim** (`scripts/_seed-utils.mjs:284`):

```js
if (isTestRuntime() && process.env.WM_ALLOW_ENV_LOAD_IN_TESTS !== '1') {
  return;   // importing a seeder does not LOAD .env.local
}
```

**The other path, unaffected by it** (`scripts/_proxy-utils.cjs:100`):

```js
return parseProxyConfig(process.env.PROXY_URL || '');   // reads whatever is already there
```

**The check that settles it,** rather than reasoning about it: run the suite with the variable both unset and exported, and see whether behaviour changes. If it does, the guard does not cover that path — regardless of what the guard's name suggests.
