// KV serving for the bootstrap public tiers (U-K4 of the KV serving plan; #5338 / #5300).
//
// Phase B of the same Worker that shadow-measured in U-K2. On a public-tier /api/bootstrap GET,
// when BOOTSTRAP_KV_SERVE enables the tier, serve the tier envelope's payload straight from KV at
// this POP — never touching Vercel/Redis, which is where the Redis egress overage comes from.
//
// Strictly additive (KTD3): any non-servable outcome — miss, invalid, stale, read error, or a KV
// read too slow to beat the client budget — yields the ORIGIN response instead, via the same
// pass-through the caller uses. The worst case is exactly today's behaviour. The serve-vs-fallback
// decision reuses the SAME classifyKvEnvelope the U-K2 shadow used (KTD4 staleness guard included),
// so what we serve and what we measured cannot drift.
//
// Slowness policy = HEDGE, not a hard timeout. U-K3 shadow data showed 10-18% of reads in real
// high-traffic metros (DEL/JNB/BKK) complete in the 500-1200 ms band — under the mobile budget but
// above any tight timeout. Abandoning those to the slower Redis path is a net loss. Instead we give
// KV a head start; only if it is still pending at HEDGE_DELAY_MS do we ALSO start origin and race
// them, serving whichever is usable first. A slow-but-valid KV read still wins and is served; a hung
// KV simply loses to origin (so no arbitrary read timeout is needed). Cost: one extra origin fetch
// on the ~1-4% of reads that outrun the hedge window — and those origin fetches often hit Vercel's
// edge cache rather than Redis.
