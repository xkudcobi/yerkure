 * #7112 — the SVG renderer's HTML overlay must stay bounded.
 *
 * `MapComponent` is the desktop renderer whenever the client has no hardware
 * WebGL2 context (`MapContainer.shouldUseDeckGL` -> `hasWebGLSupport` rejects
 * SwiftShader by name), which is the normal state of a synthetic lab runner and
 * of any GPU-blocklisted browser. It rebuilds every overlay marker on every
 * render, and each marker carries its own `click` listener — so before the
 * budget an uncapped AIS feed set the DOM size outright: 2,088 overlay markers
 * measured on production, 17.4k renderer nodes / 2.8k listeners at rest and
 * 49.7k / 21.5k mid-rebuild, against 7.6k / 736 on the DeckGL path.
 *
 * The ceiling is `MAP_OVERLAY_MARKER_BUDGET_DESKTOP` = { perLayer: 300,
 * total: 800 } (see src/utils/globe-marker-budget.ts). This spec seeds feeds an
 * order of magnitude past anything production has produced and asserts the
 * ceiling holds, that the budget cut the biggest feed rather than starving the
 * small ones, and that the cut is disclosed on the layer row.

 * shell. It now has its own FIRST_PAINT_METRIC_BUDGETS (#7867); the settled
 * diagnostic retains the 15,000-node DASHBOARD_METRIC_BUDGETS contract. The CI
 * failure that opened #7837 measured 15,506 on a settled page against that ceiling.
 *
 * Measure on CI, not locally: the two environments disagree, and CI is the one
 * the gate runs in. Run 34148378315 read 8,946-9,838 post-GC renderer nodes at
 * first paint against 10,726-10,748 settled (~72% of the ceiling), while 21
 * local loads read 5,625-6,821 against 13,985-14,167. Local data volume is not
 * CI's, so quote CI numbers when reasoning about headroom.
 *
 * `initialDataReady` is load-bearing when reading the result, not decoration.
 * The one load of those 21 that missed the hydration flag settled at 17.7 s
 * with 1,354 listeners against 1,001 on every ready load — a slow load crosses
 * the 10 s Sentry deferral window (src/bootstrap/sentry-defer.ts), and the SDK
 * adds a click handler per node. Treat a `false` sample as not comparable
 * rather than as headroom. CI itself is unaffected: variant-smoke injects no
 * secrets, so there is no VITE_SENTRY_DSN, `enabled` is false, and
 * @sentry/core's `client.init()` skips integration setup entirely.
 *
 * Recorded, never asserted. Both the wait and the read are best-effort: a
 * settled sample that could redden a required gate would trade the flake this
 * issue exists to remove for a new one. A failure is recorded as its message
 * rather than swallowed, a timeout as `wait.quiesced === false`, and either way
 * the attachment says which — an absent sample must never read as a clean one.
 *
 * The whole diagnostic is raced against SETTLED_SAMPLE_BUDGET_MS because
 * nothing inside it is otherwise bounded: `waitForDomQuiescence`'s deadline
 * governs its poll loop, but a wedged renderer hangs INSIDE a `page.evaluate`
 * or a CDP `Performance.getMetrics` — a promise that never settles, which no
 * try/catch can rescue. Unbounded, this optional sample could eat the test's
 * budget and report a timeout in place of a genuine budget violation. The
 * losing promise keeps its own catch so the rejection it takes when the context
 * closes never surfaces as an unhandled rejection.
