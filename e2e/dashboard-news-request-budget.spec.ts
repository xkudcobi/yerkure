// Request budget for the news load on a default anonymous dashboard load (#5376).
//
// What went wrong in production, measured on a live anonymous
// www.worldmonitor.app/dashboard session via Resource Timing:
//
//   rss-proxy         20   window 1,347 → 2,319 ms
//   list-feed-digest   2   at 994 ms and 2,162 ms          ← news loaded twice
//
// Two independent defects produced that:
//
//  1. `commodities`, `supply-chain` and `live-news` are CANONICAL_FEEDS category
//     keys whose panel key is owned by a NON-news panel (CommoditiesPanel prices,
//     SupplyChainPanel, LiveNewsPanel 24/7 video). The data panel's
//     `enabled: true` promoted them into the news work-list as *custom*
//     categories, and custom categories were exempt from BOTH the digest and the
//     per-feed feed cap — 4+8+7 = 19 uncapped /api/rss-proxy fetches, rendered
//     into nothing because those keys have no NewsPanel.
//  2. `loadAllData()`'s task list always contained an unconditional `news` task,
//     and its drain loop re-runs the whole list when a second `loadAllData()`
//     arrives while the first is in flight (panel-layout's hydration trigger +
//     App.ts's bootstrap fan-out). Every trigger re-fetched the digest even
//     though nothing about the news load is viewport-gated.
//
// This spec is the budget guard for both: one digest request, zero rss-proxy
// requests, and none of the `Custom category …` warnings.
//
// Note on the "zero rss-proxy" assertion: preset categories missing from the
// digest do NOT fall back to per-feed fetching on web — that path is gated off
// by the `newsPerFeedFallback` runtime flag (default false). Custom categories
// bypassed that gate entirely, which is why the trio showed up as raw proxy
// traffic. So a non-zero count here means a category is being resolved that has
// no business being fetched client-side.

// bounds: a custom category now rotates its window by the cap on each refresh
// cycle (fixed prefixes made feeds 4..N unreachable forever), so N loads reach
// up to N × cap distinct feeds over time. This spec seeds a fresh anonymous
// profile, so the persisted rotation cycle starts at 0 and the window is the
// leading prefix — exactly the pre-rotation feed set.
//
// That makes the assertion below transitively a single-load guard too: a second
