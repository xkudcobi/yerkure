/**
 * DOM-behavioral test project (#5634).
 *
 * Deliberately SEPARATE from the `tsx --test` unit profile (`npm run
 * test:data`) for two reasons:
 *
 *   1. Gate components import `@/services/i18n`, which uses `import.meta.glob`
 *      to split the locale dictionaries. tsx cannot transform that — only a
 *      Vite pipeline can — so these files are unreachable from the node:test
 *      runner no matter how the DOM globals are registered.
 *   2. `test:data` already runs ~390 files in one tsx process and OOMs at the
 *      tail in a worktree. Adding a DOM environment to that glob would make it
 *      worse; a separate runner keeps the blast radius at these files only.
 *
 * happy-dom over jsdom: 6 transitive packages instead of ~30, and it boots per
 * file fast enough that the extra CI job stays under a few seconds.
