/**
 * "A settings entry with no panel" — the class of bug #5871 was.
 *
 * `commodities-news` shipped enabled by default on the finance variant
 * (`FINANCE_PANELS`) and inside the `finCommodities` mission preset, but the
 * CANONICAL_FEEDS pass in panel-layout only remapped a colliding feed category
 * to `${key}-news` for a hardcoded `markets`/`crypto`/`economic` set. The
 * `commodities` key is BOTH a FINANCE_FEEDS category and the key CommoditiesPanel
 * registers under, so the NewsPanel asked for `commodities`, the dedup guard
 * dropped it, and no panel was ever created. Users got a "Commodities News"
 * toggle that did nothing.
 *
 * Two things are asserted here, and they need each other:
 *
 *  1. The REAL resolver (`newsPanelKeyForCategory`, extracted from the loop so
 *     it is reachable from a test at all) is driven over the REAL catalog. A
 *     source regex asserting "panel-layout no longer has a hardcoded set" would
 *     go green the moment someone reintroduced one under a different name, and
 *     could never tell which catalog entries are actually reachable.
 *  2. The pass is replayed in registration ORDER, because the collision only
 *     exists because CommoditiesPanel registers first. A test that ignored order
 *     could not distinguish "remapped to commodities-news" from "silently lost".
 *
 * Mutation-verified: restoring the hardcoded `new Set(['markets','crypto',
 * 'economic'])` inside `newsPanelKeyForCategory` fails
 * "every *-news catalog entry is reachable" with `commodities-news` orphaned.
 *
 * The catalog and the registration order are read from source rather than
 * imported: `src/config/panels.ts` and `src/config/feeds.ts` both reach
 * `import.meta.env` transitively (via `@/utils/proxy`), which the tsx runner
 * behind `npm run test:data` cannot provide. Only literal object keys and
 * literal registration keys are extracted — no behavior is mirrored here; every
 * decision below comes from the imported production function.
