/**
 * A recorded `termsVersion` has to resolve to the text that was accepted.
 *
 * Replaces `tests/terms-version-archive.test.mts` (#6982), whose dated snapshot
 * pages were dropped for git history (owner decision, 2026-08-20). The archive
 * caught three failures; this keeps all three, the third by digest rather than
 * by body-for-body comparison against a snapshot:
 *
 *   1. A legal page edited without bumping "Last updated" — every user who
 *      accepted the old wording silently maps to text they never saw.
 *   2. A version bumped on one document but not its siblings — one stamped
 *      version names all three, so they have to agree.
 *   3. TERMS_VERSION drifting from the date the pages actually carry.
 *
 * What git history gives that a snapshot page did not: every version, not just
 * the ones someone remembered to archive, and the diff between any two.
