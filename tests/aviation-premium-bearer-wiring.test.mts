/**
 * A Pro subscriber's browser must actually send credentials to the gated
 * aviation routes.
 *
 * Gating the server is only half the job. `premiumFetch` attaches the Clerk
 * Bearer ONLY for paths in PREMIUM_RPC_PATHS, and only if the client was built
 * with `fetch: premiumFetch` in the first place. Miss either half and the
 * server denies paying Pro users on their own subscription — which is exactly
 * what happened to /api/chat-analyst (see the comment on its registry entry),
 * and the symptom stayed hidden for two PRs.
 *
 * So this asserts the end-to-end effect — a real call through the aviation
 * service carries Authorization — rather than asserting the wiring exists.
 * Reverting either the registry entry or the premiumFetch wrapper turns it red.
