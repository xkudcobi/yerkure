// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why this test exists
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `premiumFetch` (src/services/premium-fetch.ts) only attaches the Clerk
// Bearer token when the target path is a member of `PREMIUM_RPC_PATHS`. A
// premium-gated direct-edge endpoint that's *missing* from that set silently
// breaks for browser Pro users who don't carry a tester key:
//
//   premiumFetch sees the path is "not premium" → skips Bearer injection →
//   request goes out unauthenticated → server's isCallerPremium returns
//   false → 403 "Pro subscription required" despite a valid subscription.
//
// That exact regression hit `/api/chat-analyst` (post-PR-#3797). The fix is
// trivial — add the path to PREMIUM_RPC_PATHS — but the trap is that it
// stays invisible until someone manages to call the endpoint AND has no
// tester key AND isn't on a desktop with WORLDMONITOR_API_KEY.
//
// This guard fails CI when a new file under `api/` gates on premium auth
// (via `isCallerPremium()` or returns the literal 403 body) but the
// corresponding route isn't covered by PREMIUM_RPC_PATHS or this file's
// allowlist.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Allowlist — endpoints whose browser callers deliberately bypass premiumFetch
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Each entry must point to a real file under `api/` and explain WHY path-
// gated Bearer injection isn't the right mechanism for that endpoint.

// Gateway-level direct-LLM routes also require a Clerk identity before quota
// reservation. Browser callers must therefore enter through premiumFetch so
// they attach Bearer auth and so the wm-session interceptor does not mistake
// the expected anonymous 401 for a dead HttpOnly session. Summarize stays out:
// its translate mode is intentionally available to free callers and the
// gateway only applies direct-LLM quota after inspecting the request body.
//
// #5674 — an entry here is NOT sufficient on its own. Membership in
// PREMIUM_RPC_PATHS does two independent jobs: it tells premiumFetch to attach
// a Bearer, and it tells the wm-session interceptor that a 401 on this route is
// an expected auth denial rather than a rejected session cookie. This allowlist
// was originally justified against the FIRST job only, which left the second
// unhandled: every unauthenticated summarize call 401'd, the interceptor minted
// a fresh session, replayed, 401'd again, and suppressed ALL anonymous API
// calls for 15 minutes (#5219). Each entry must therefore also name the
