/**
 * A pricing card must state how many people the plan covers (#5726).
 *
 * Pro and Pro Business are one seat each, and neither card said so. Adjacent
 * copy invited "teams" — the axis header over that column, and the "Best for"
 * line on the agent-facing sheet. Since #6982/#6983 the buyer also *accepts*
 * the EULA at the checkout button, and EULA §4.1 says Pro Business is "One
 * named subscriber" and excludes "Shared login access". So the card and the
 * licence the same click binds you to disagreed.
 *
 * The invariant here is the pairing, not the wording: while the licence says a
 * tier is single-seat, every surface that sells it has to say so too. Change
 * the product to multi-seat (#6636) and this fails until the licence moves
 * with it — which is the point.
