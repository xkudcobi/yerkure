/**
 * #6577 — panels that repaint `this.content` themselves must clear the WHOLE
 * error state on their success render, not just the header chip.
 *
 * `showError(msg, onRetry)` does three things: it sets the header "Error" chip,
 * it arms a `setInterval` countdown that fires `onRetry` when it reaches zero,
 * and it advances `retryAttempt` so the next failure waits twice as long
 * (15s -> 30s -> 60s ... capped at 180s).
 *
 * `setContentHtml` unwinds all three implicitly. Panels that paint with
 * `replaceChildren(this.content, ...)` bypass that path, so they must clear the
 * whole state themselves. The panels below used to call `setErrorState(false)`,
 * which drops ONLY the chip — leaving the countdown ticking against a panel that
 * had already recovered (one redundant refresh per recovery) and leaving the
 * backoff latched a step high, so the next real failure re-entered at the wrong
 * rung.
 *
 * SUPERSEDED MECHANISM, SAME CONTRACT (#6678). #6577's fix was an explicit
 * `clearErrorState()` next to each raw write, because `Panel.setContentNodes` /
 * `setTrustedContent` did not exist yet. They do now, and #6678 routed all five
 * panels' SUCCESS writes through them — so the clear is part of the write and
 * none of these panels calls `clearErrorState()` directly any more. Do NOT copy
 * the old idiom into a new panel; use the sanctioned helpers.
 *
 * The cases below are unaffected because they drive each panel's real
 * `render()` / `setData()` / `renderArticles()` chain rather than the clear
 * itself — a broken clear inside the helper still fails them. What they no
 * longer pin is WHICH mechanism performs the clear; the per-call-site lock-bail
 * proof for the new mechanism lives in
 * `tests/dom/panel-content-write-6678.test.mts`.
 *
 * Each case drives the panel's OWN error and success call sites rather than the
 * shared `Panel` helper: a single mutation of `clearErrorState()` would be
 * killed by any one of them, but a per-site regression (one panel left on
 * `setErrorState`) is only visible if every site is exercised separately.
 * See docs/solutions/conventions/mutate-each-call-site-a-global-mutant-hides-per-site-holes.md
 *
 * The LOADING branches must NOT move to `clearErrorState()`, and the final
 * describe block pins that. Resetting `retryAttempt` on a loading render would
 * re-arm every retry at 15s forever and defeat the exponential backoff — so the
 * invariant there is the inverse of the one above: the rung must SURVIVE.
 *
 * The two loading shapes are not equivalent, and the distinction matters when
 * reading those cases:
 *   - `showLoading()` (Panel.ts) clears the chip AND the countdown, but
 *     deliberately leaves `retryAttempt` alone.
 *   - the raw `replaceChildren(this.content, …)` loading branches in
 *     ServiceStatus/TechEvents/DefensePatents clear NEITHER — the chip stays red
 *     and the interval keeps ticking for the whole retry fetch.
 * Both preserve the rung, which is the only property asserted below.
 *
 * REACHABILITY — three of these five panels are latent, not live. Only
 * TechEventsPanel and DefensePatentsPanel call an RPC that can actually reject:
 *   - ServiceStatusPanel: `fetchServiceStatuses` runs inside a CircuitBreaker
 *     whose `execute()` never rejects, and both of its returns hardcode
 *     `success: true` — so `if (!data.success) throw` is dead code and
 *     `showError` at :83 is unreachable.
 *   - GdeltIntelPanel: `fetchGdeltArticles` returns [] on `resp.error` and
 *     `fetchTopicTimeline` has a bare `catch { return null }`, so
 *     `loadActiveTopic`'s catch never runs and `showError` at :93 is unreachable.
 *   - GivingPanel: no caller ever passes an `onRetry` (see its case below).
 * Their cases reach the error state by injecting the private field or forcing a
 * mock rejection — states production cannot currently produce. They pin the
 * contract for the day those paths are made reachable; they are not evidence a
 * live user-facing bug was fixed on those three.

/**
 * The inverse half of #6577, and the reason none of the five edits above may be

 * LOADING render must NOT — otherwise every retry re-arms at the 15s floor and
 * the ladder never climbs toward the 180s cap.
 *
 * Without these two cases the rule lives only in the prose above, so a
 * contributor "fixing" the red chip that lingers during a retry fetch could swap
 * a loading branch onto `clearErrorState()` and defeat exponential backoff with
 * a fully green suite.
 *
 * Both loading shapes are covered because they differ in what else they touch:
 * the raw `replaceChildren` branch clears neither chip nor countdown, while
 * `showLoading()` clears both. Only the rung is asserted, since that is the one
 * property both must share.
 *
 * TechEventsPanel is the vehicle for both because it is one of only two panels
 * in this file whose error path is genuinely reachable in production, so the
 * rung it reports is a real one. Note the asymmetry, though: the first case
 * drives TechEvents' OWN loading branch (the raw `replaceChildren` at
 * TechEventsPanel.ts:71 — the only loading shape it has), while the second calls
 * the inherited `showLoading()` directly. TechEvents never calls `showLoading()`
 * itself; the panels that take that shape are GdeltIntelPanel (:76) and
 * GivingPanel (:28, constructor only). The second case is therefore a
 * base-class contract test riding on a convenient subclass, not a per-call-site
