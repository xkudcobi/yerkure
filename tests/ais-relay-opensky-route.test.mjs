// Guards for the OpenSky route selector and the 403-vs-429 metric split.
//
// Why the route is SELECTED and never cascades: OpenSky's rate limit is per ACCOUNT
// (4,000 credits/day keyed on OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID — scripts/_opensky-account-cooldown.cjs
// says so outright, and docs/solutions/integration-issues/
// opensky-bbox-area-billing-flat-top-tier.md measured the exhaustion), NOT per exit IP.
// A residential exit buys no quota, so an automatic proxy-on-failure fallback would
// spend a SECOND account credit retrying the one error class a different IP cannot fix.
// Reintroducing a cascade would be a cost regression that no panel would show.
//
// ais-relay.cjs is a non-exported monolith that executes on import (see its own note at
// the top), so — as with tests/ais-relay-opensky-proxy-tls.test.mjs — the durable
// coverage is a source guard plus a behavioural test of the shared helper it overrides.
