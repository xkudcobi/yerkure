// Static guard: in every budgeted `scripts/seed-bundle-*.mjs`, each section's
// worst-case wall time (`timeoutMs` + the runner's SIGTERM→SIGKILL grace) must
// fit `maxBundleMs`.
//
// Why this needs a CI gate rather than a code review:
//
// `_bundle-runner.mjs` admits a section only when
// `elapsed + timeoutMs + KILL_GRACE_MS <= maxBundleMs`. That check is a
// load-shed — it assumes the section fits the budget at all, and defers it to
// the next tick when the current one is too far along. A section whose worst
// case exceeds the WHOLE budget fails the check on every tick forever, and
// deferral is not an error, so the bundle still exits 0 and Railway paints
// SUCCESS.
//
// #6556: `seed-bundle-resilience` shipped `maxBundleMs: 570_000` alongside
// sections of 600s, 900s and 600s. The cheapest needed 610s. All three were
// deferred on every tick, `ran:0`, exit 0, green badge — and the service
// published nothing for six hours. The only detector was seed-meta ageing past
// a 14h staleness alarm, roughly fourteen hours after the service died.
//
// The runner now refuses to start on that config (see
// `findUnadmittableSections`), which turns the silent stall into a loud one.
// This gate is the earlier tripwire: it fails the PR that would deploy it.
