// `ENGLISH_CEILING` measures English-identical strings, so a wholesale

//
// WHY NOT THE ROUND TRIP AS SPECIFIED. The issue (and my own comment on it)
// proposed flagging any value where `s2t(value) !== value`. Measured, that is
// not usable in either direction:
//
//   * False positives. Feeding already-Traditional text to a Simplified→
//     Traditional converter is not idempotent — OpenCC applies its orthodox
//     variant preferences. Over the committed catalogues it rewrites 表→錶,
//     干→幹, 峰→峯, 群→羣, 核→覈, 床→牀, 才→纔 and flags 61 correct values
//     (47 with `to: 'tw'`). 儀表板 and GPS干擾 are not Simplified residue.
//   * False negatives. `s2t('許可權') === '許可權'`. Every section-A term is
//     spelled in Traditional characters — they are Mainland *vocabulary*, not
//     Simplified script — so no character-level converter can see them.
//
// So the converter is applied to the Simplified SOURCE, which is what it is for
// and where it is well-defined, and vocabulary is checked separately against the
// decisions already recorded in the generator.
