// ─── WORLDMONITOR-12A: the limiter scope must be wired at the CALL SITE ──────
//
// `server/_shared/rate-limit.ts` can separate an API key's bucket from an
// interactive session's, but only if the gateway actually tells it which
// credential the caller presented. Those are two different failures, and the
// module-level test in `tests/rate-limit.test.mts` cannot see the second one:
// deleting both `principalScope` arguments from gateway.ts leaves that suite
// fully green (verified by mutation, 2026-09-11).
//
// Rather than pin the two literal call sites — which a third limiter call would
// silently slip past — assert the invariant: every limiter option object that
// names a principal must also name that principal's scope. A new call site that
// forgets the scope re-opens the bug, and re-opening it means a paying customer's
// own scraper can starve their dashboard again.
//
// This is a source pin because driving a real API-key request through
// `createDomainGateway` needs key validation, entitlement resolution and Redis;
// the behaviour it guards is already proven against the limiter itself.
