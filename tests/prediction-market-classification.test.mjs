// Producer-side pool classification for prediction:markets-bootstrap:v1 (#5733).
//
// The bug: seed-prediction-markets built its pools as
//   geopolitical = filterAndScore(markets, null)                     // NO filter
//   tech         = filterAndScore(markets, m => m.tags ∈ TECH_TAGS)
//   finance      = filterAndScore(markets, m => kalshi || tags ∈ FINANCE_TAGS)
// so (a) `geopolitical` was an unfiltered copy of EVERY market, and (b) the tech
// and finance tag lists shared `economy`/`crypto`/`business`, which made the
// three pools near-duplicates. Production on 2026-07-30 published 75 records
// covering only 46 distinct markets, and the geopolitical pool's top-volume
// entry was a Fed-rates market at $45.6M.
//
// These tests run the REAL classifier against the REAL production records in
// tests/fixtures/prediction-markets-raw-candidates.json.
