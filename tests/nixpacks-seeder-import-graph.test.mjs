// #5266 — static dependency-contract guard for the `nixpacks-root-scripts`
// Railway seeder services.
//
// These 21 services are NOT built from a Dockerfile in this repo. Railway
// builds them with `rootDirectory: scripts`, which means the build context IS
// scripts/ — the container's /app is a copy of scripts/, and `npm ci` installs
// ONLY what scripts/package.json declares. Two consequences, both of which
// have already caused production crashes:
//
//   1. BARE SPECIFIER BUDGET. A package in the ROOT package.json is invisible
//      to these containers. That is exactly how #5266 broke
//      seed-bundle-relay-backup: scripts/seed-global-tenders.mjs imports
//      `papaparse`, which the root package.json declares and scripts/
//      package.json does not. It resolves on every dev machine (root
//      node_modules) and dies in the container with
//      ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package 'papaparse'.
//
//      A package that is merely HOISTED into scripts/node_modules as some
//      other dependency's transitive child is not good enough either — that
//      is a resolution accident, not a contract. `fast-xml-parser` (same file)
//      only resolved because @aws-sdk/client-s3 happens to pull it in; an
//      npm tree reshuffle or an aws-sdk bump silently turns it into the next
//      papaparse. The budget below is therefore the DECLARED dependencies of
//      scripts/package.json, never the installed tree.
//
//   2. CONTAINMENT. scripts/ is the whole container. A relative import that
//      escapes it (../server/..., ../shared/...) resolves fine in the repo and
//      crashes in production with "Cannot find module '/server/_shared/X.mjs'
//      imported from /app/Y.mjs".
//
// ESM resolves a module's full static import closure eagerly, so ONE bad edge
// anywhere in the closure crashes the cron at startup even when the importing
// code path never runs.
//
// Resolution model: the bundle runner spawns members with
// `spawn(process.execPath, [scriptPath])` (scripts/_bundle-runner.mjs) — plain
// `node`. A member can explicitly register the declared `tsx` dependency with
// `tsx/esm/api` before its first TypeScript dynamic import. That loader applies
// to the member's remaining graph; every other root keeps plain-node rules.
//
// The walker/tokenizer machinery is shared with the Dockerfile-based container
// guards (tests/resilience-validation-import-graph.test.mjs), which own its
// self-tests; this file only supplies the nixpacks container contract.
