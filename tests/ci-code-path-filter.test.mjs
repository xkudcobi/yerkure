// The `changes` job in test.yml decides whether the `unit` job runs, and `unit`
// is where every generator drift test lives. It computes that decision with an
// awk program embedded in a single-quoted shell string — so a stray apostrophe
// in a comment ends the string, the step dies, and every dependent job reports
// "skipping" rather than "failed". `gh pr checks --watch` exits 0 on that, so
// the whole thing reads green while nothing was verified (#6038).
//
// These tests execute the real program extracted from the workflow, through
// bash, exactly as CI does.
