 * only), so a helper both surfaces need is physically duplicated. The copies

 * The set is every same-named pair under `src/services/` and
 * `pro-test/src/services/` that is byte-identical today:
 *
 * - `timeout-signal.ts` joined with WORLDMONITOR-109. Each root's
 *   `checkout-transport.ts` imports it as `./timeout-signal`, so that
 *   specifier only resolves in both bundles if the helper exists at the same
 *   relative path under each root. Drift is quiet and therefore dangerous:
 *   the import still resolves, nothing fails loudly, and one bundle silently
 *   loses its old-engine fallback and goes back to throwing before `fetch` —
 *   the exact WORLDMONITOR-109 crash, which was a /pro bug, so the marketing
 *   copy is the one that must not rot.
 * - `checkout-transport.ts` carries the checkout POST contract both surfaces
 *   depend on (`postCreateCheckout`, the retryable-status set, the retry
 *   delay, and the `Idempotency-Key`/`Authorization` headers). A one-sided
 *   edit — adding a retryable status on the dashboard, say — would ship a
 *   different retry policy to /pro with nothing going red.
 *
 * Keep this list equal to that byte-identical set: adding a pair that has
 * legitimately diverged would red the gate permanently, and omitting one
 * leaves a live drift channel unwatched.
