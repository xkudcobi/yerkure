/**
 * Guards the contract #7222 established: the /pro marketing bundle carries NO
 * dependency on the `dodopayments-checkout` SDK.
 *
 * Checkout on /pro is a top-level redirect to Dodo's HOSTED page (#4449) — it
 * needs no client SDK. The dormant `initOverlay`, which held the only
 * `import('dodopayments-checkout')` under pro-test/, was deleted in #7222 along
 * with the dependency in pro-test/package.json.
 *
 * Use a source sweep so a future root dependency cannot silently restore the
 * SDK through ancestor node_modules resolution. The dashboard overlay and its
 * root dependency have now also been removed.
 *
 * Why the sweep is DERIVED and not a directory listing (PR #7259 review): the
 * /pro bundle's source surface is larger than pro-test/src. Modules there
 * import repo-level `shared/` helpers by relative path (`../../../shared/...`),
 * and those files are bundle inputs too — an SDK import inside one would ship
 * to /pro while a pro-test/src-only sweep stayed green. So the set is walked
 * transitively from pro-test/src across every escaping relative import. A
 * hand-maintained list of "the shared files /pro happens to use today" would
 * rot the moment someone adds an import, which is the same allowlist-rot
 * failure this PR already fixed once in the mirror-parity gate.
 *
 * Scope note: this bans the specifier outright — including a `import type` —
 * because a type-only import is the usual first step back to a value import,
 * and /pro has no legitimate use for the SDK's types now that the overlay is
 * gone. The dashboard's own value-import guard lives separately in
 * tests/panel-cluster-chunks.test.mjs (checkoutSdkValueImportOffenders), which
 * allows the type import and only forbids a static value import.
