// Country-designator resolution for the MCP tool layer (WORLDMONITOR-Y2).
//
// The four country-scoped RPC tools used to coerce their argument with
// `String(params.country_code ?? '').toUpperCase().slice(0, 2)`. Truncation is
// not merely lossy here — it is silently WRONG. The downstream proto only
// enforces `^[A-Z]{2}$` (proto/worldmonitor/intelligence/v1/get_country_risk.proto),
// so a country NAME truncated to two letters passes validation and returns a
// different country's intelligence:
//
//     "Iraq"   -> "IR" -> Iran          "China"  -> "CH" -> Switzerland
//     "Israel" -> "IS" -> Iceland       "Nigeria"-> "NI" -> Nicaragua
//
// Only the residue that truncates to something invalid ("" from a missing arg)
// ever reached Sentry as an HTTP 400. The wrong-country answers were silent.
//
// These cases pin the resolution ladder, the three data invariants its ORDER
// rests on, agreement with the sibling CommonJS resolver, and — through the
// real MCP handler — that the tools now send the resolved code downstream.
