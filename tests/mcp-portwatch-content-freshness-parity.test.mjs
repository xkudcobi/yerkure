// run whose decision-critical country (CN/HK) content is past a 144h budget is
// STALE_CONTENT, not OK. The MCP envelope over that same key kept answering
// only the transport/cardinality questions, so an MCP consumer read
// `stale: false` for the exact key the operator surface called content-stale.

// #4293 closed this identical shape on the cardinality dimension for this key
// and this tool. These tests hold the two surfaces together on the content
// dimension, and pin the `_freshnessChecks` mirror claim to health's real
// exported config rather than to a comment.
