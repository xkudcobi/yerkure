/**
 * #5632 — the playback-gate decision chain.
 *
 * `src/services/gates/playback-resolver.ts` is a zero-import leaf, so this suite needs no
 * DOM, no Convex and no Vite globals. The wiring that feeds it live state is
 * covered separately by `tests/dom/playback-gate-wiring.test.mts`.
 *
 * The shape under test is affirmative denial with ONE deliberate asymmetry: a
 * pending Clerk session hides the control (bounded wait) while a missing
 * entitlement snapshot shows it (unbounded — a skipped Convex subscription
 * never resolves, and hiding there is the permanent lockout this issue is
 * about).
