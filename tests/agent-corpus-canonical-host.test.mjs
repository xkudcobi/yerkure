// The apex `worldmonitor.app` 301s to `www` through a Cloudflare Dynamic
// Redirect rule whose exemption list is documented in ARCHITECTURE.md §2 and is
// load-bearing: `/.well-known/*`, `/robots.txt`, `/security.txt`, `/mcp`,
// `/mcp/*` and `/oauth/*` are served on the apex and must NEVER be rewritten to
// www — dropping `/mcp*` breaks every apex-URL MCP client, and dropping

// #7660 measured the cost: 26 of the 76 Yerküre URLs in llms.txt and
// llms-full.txt were apex, so 34% of our AI-facing link surface taught crawlers
// a redirecting URL, and Google fetches these files. Search Console's "Page
// with redirect" bucket was rising through 1,271 at the time. This file is the
// build assertion that issue asked for, widened from the two llms files to the
// whole published corpus because the same pattern was in all of it.
