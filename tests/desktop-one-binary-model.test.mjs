// desktop app ships one binary or one binary per variant. The endpoints, the
// workflow, the packager, the switcher, and the docs each encoded a different
// answer, and nothing failed when they drifted. These assertions are the
// agreement itself: the model is "one published binary, variants switch
// in-app", and every surface has to keep saying so.

// This file is a verification mechanism, so it is written to fail loudly rather
// than silently cover less than it claims: every lookup that could return
// `undefined` after a rename is asserted to have found something, and the
// release-publisher scan walks ALL workflows rather than trusting a filename.
