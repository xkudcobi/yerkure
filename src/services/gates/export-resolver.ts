 * Pure decision chain for the dashboard + country-brief data exports, plus the
 * catalog-activation probe that decides whether the gate exists at all. The tab
 * cap is a sibling resolver over the SAME inputs and the SAME activation
 * signal, so the two takeaways can never disagree about who is entitled.
 *
 * Why a dedicated resolver instead of `hasFeature('dataExport')`: that helper
 * coerces `undefined → false` (src/services/entitlements.ts:163), i.e. it FAILS
 * CLOSED — the exact opposite of what this gate needs. A late, failed or
 * skipped entitlement snapshot must never lock a paying customer out of their
 * own data (post-mortem: src/app/panel-layout.ts:710-735). `hasPremiumAccess()`
 * is equally wrong in the other direction: it is true for every Pro subscriber,
 * and export is a Pro Business takeaway.
 *
 * MUST stay a leaf that only imports the zero-import `billing-state` module: it
 * is unit-tested under `tsx --test` (no jsdom, no Vite globals), and both
 * services and the app layer import it.
