/**
 * Historical-playback gate (#5632).
 *
 * The control used to be hidden behind `authState.user?.role === 'pro'`, but
 * nothing in this codebase writes Clerk `publicMetadata.plan`/`role`, so that
 * field reads `'free'` for every account — the control rendered for nobody.
 *
 * Playback is a Pro takeaway (tier >= 1), not a Pro Business one, so the
 * positive signal is `hasPremiumAccess()`. What is NOT delegated to it is the
 * failure direction: it returns `false` for every "we don't know yet" state,
 * and shipping that verbatim would trade a permanent gate on a dead field for
 * a permanent gate on a missing snapshot.
 *
 * Zero-import leaf on purpose: it is unit-tested under `tsx --test` (no jsdom,
 * no Vite globals), and both the services and app layers consume it. Keep it
 * that way — see the same constraint on `export-resolver.ts`.

/**
 * Decide whether the playback control is shown.
 *
 * Order matters, and the two "unknown" states resolve DIFFERENTLY on purpose:
 *
 *   1. premium access      → visible (covers every entitlement path at once)
 *   2. auth pending        → pending. Bounded whenever Clerk is configured: it
 *      hydrates within its ~4s idle window and the subscription re-runs this
 *      immediately after. (With no publishable key `isPending` is sticky —
 *      clerk.ts's `isClerkAuthEnabled` exists for that case — but no entitled
 *      session can be stuck behind it, since every premium path short-circuits
 *      at step 1 and `isEntitled()` transitively requires Clerk anyway.)
 *      Waiting costs a subscriber a brief delay; the alternative flashes a
 *      Pro-only control into every anonymous visitor's header and then yanks it.
 *   3. signed out          → denied. The only affirmative denial available
 *      without a snapshot — anonymous sessions have no entitlement row to read.
 *   4. no snapshot yet     → VISIBLE. Unbounded, unlike step 2: a skipped or
 *      failed Convex subscription never resolves, so hiding here would be a
 *      permanent lockout for a paying customer rather than a boot blip. Never
 *      over-gate (post-mortem: src/app/panel-layout.ts:723-748). A signed-in
 *      free user therefore sees the control until their snapshot lands; the
 *      caller must handle losing it mid-use (event-handlers.ts exitPlayback).
 *   5. otherwise           → denied. Signed in, snapshot loaded, and no premium
 *      path matched — the one state we affirmatively know is unentitled. An
 *      expired or lapsed row lands here too, which is correct: `isEntitled()`
 *      already rejected it on `validUntil`.
