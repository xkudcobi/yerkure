/**
 * Runtime-correct "send the user to this URL, outside the app".
 *
 * Desktop (Tauri) hands the URL to the OS browser through the `open_url` IPC
 * command. Navigating the WebView itself replaces the entire app with a
 * third-party page and leaves the user with no browser chrome to get back; for
 * payment pages it also runs 3DS/fraud checks inside an embedded WebView,
 * which is exactly the nesting that hung Dodo checkouts in #4449.
 *
 * Web keeps the popup-blocker dance: browsers only honour `window.open()`
 * inside a live user gesture, so a caller may reserve a blank tab
 * synchronously in its click handler (`prereserveExternalTab`) and pass the
 * handle here to be navigated once the async work resolves.
 *
 * The Rust side of `open_url` accepts `https://` only (plus `http://` for
 * localhost) and opens through the OS default handler, never a shell — see
 * `src-tauri/src/main.rs` and `src-tauri/open-url-safety.test.mjs`. The same
 * URL-scheme gate is checked here before any native or browser fallback so an
 * unsupported scheme cannot be reopened by `window.open`. It is exported
 * (`isOpenableExternalUrl`) so callers that cancel a click before delegating —
 * the anchor interceptor in `app/event-handlers.ts` — can gate on the SAME
 * predicate; a looser gate there turns every URL this module refuses into a
 * dead click.
 *
 * NOTE for anyone touching a `window.open` here: this module deliberately does
 * NOT pass `noopener`/`noreferrer`, because either one makes `window.open`
 * return null while still opening the tab, and every branch below reads that
 * handle to decide what happened. `openWindowWithHandle` severs `opener`
 * manually instead. See its comment before changing a feature string.
