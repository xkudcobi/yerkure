/**
 * Pure billing UX state derivation (#4771).
 *
 * Turns the two reactive client snapshots (Convex subscription row +
 * entitlement row) into one explicit customer-facing billing state, so the
 * UI can distinguish "we are verifying your renewal" from "you are a free
 * user" instead of showing a generic Upgrade CTA to a paying customer whose
 * local renewal evidence went stale (missed/exhausted webhook).
 *
 * Server-side counterparts: the on-demand Dodo re-check (#4770/#5447) writes
 * `subscriptions.renewalVerificationState`, and the gateway/MCP already emit
 * the matching stable codes (`renewal_verification_pending/failed`,
 * `subscription_lapsed`) via `server/_shared/entitlement-check.ts`.
 *
 * MUST stay a zero-import leaf: it is unit-tested under `tsx --test`
 * (no jsdom, no Vite globals), and both services and components import it.

 * webhook was missed still "covers" here while `deriveBillingUxState`
 * correctly routes it to `renewal_verification_*`/`lapsed` — the exact case
 * this module was built for (#4770/#4771). `on_hold` and `cancelled` are both
 * bounded by the paid-through end. Anything deciding access must call
 * `deriveBillingUxState`; this only answers the narrower field-level question.
 *
 * Its purpose is to be the single shared spelling of that question, so the
 * cancelled-but-paid-through rule cannot be re-derived from status-string
 * intuition in one place and not another (#7315 — the settings panel had its
 * own inline ternary and painted a paid-through plan the same red as a dead
 * one). `deriveBillingUxState` and `getSubscriptionStatusTone` both read it.
 *
 * Mirrors `isCoveringAt` in convex/payments/subscriptionHelpers.ts: active,
 * on_hold-but-paid-through, or cancelled-but-paid-through. `expired` never
 * covers, whatever its period end. Boundary differs deliberately from the
 * server helper's `>`: the client keeps the inclusive `>=` this module has
 * always used, so a row landing exactly on `now` never blinks locked between
 * snapshots. That exception is recorded in CONCEPTS.md § Covering Subscription
 * — a later dedup of the two helpers has to preserve both boundaries rather
 * than picking one.

 * How a subscription row should be *painted*, as a tone rather than a colour —

 * still inside its paid window. The panel needs to tell those apart, because a
 * cancelled-but-paid-through plan IS ending — just not today (#7315).
 *
 * `unknown` is the explicit escape for a provider status this client does not
 * model yet. It exists so a new Dodo status cannot be swallowed into the
 * end-of-coverage tone and assert to an entitled user that their plan is dead.
 *
 * The `default` arm is a RUNTIME escape only. Left bare it would also silence
 * the compiler: widening the status union (convex/schema.ts keeps it to these
 * four) would then typecheck clean and ship as a permanently unexplained grey
 * card. The `never` assignment keeps the runtime fallback while making that
 * widening a build error, so a new status has to be given a tone deliberately.

 *    in-period row stays `active` (entitlement snapshot late/skipped), and a
 *    past-period row is `renewal_verification_pending` — reconciliation is
 *    queued (#4794) or in flight (#4770) even when no verdict is recorded yet.
 * 5. `cancelled` still inside its paid window keeps coverage (`active`) even
 *    when the entitlement snapshot is late — mirrors `isCoveringAt` in
 *    convex/payments/subscriptionHelpers.ts ("cancelled-but-paid-through").
 *    `on_hold`/`cancelled` past the window and `expired` (never covering, same
