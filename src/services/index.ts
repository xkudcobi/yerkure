// economic is NOT re-exported here (#4571): it runs a module-load side effect
// (new EconomicServiceClient() + circuit breakers), so an `export *` re-export
// keeps it un-tree-shakeable in eager main.js. Its consumers import it directly
// (`@/services/economic`) or dynamically (data-loader), so it tree-shakes out.
