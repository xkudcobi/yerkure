/**
 * Premium access, panel gate reasons, and CTA routing.
 *
 * Per-gate logic does NOT live here (#5813). Each gate owns a pure resolver
 * leaf plus a reader beside it under `gates/` — `gates/export.ts` (data export
 * + dashboard tab cap) and `gates/playback.ts` (historical playback). A fourth
 * gate gets its own pair there, not another `readX`/`evaluateX` in this file.
 *
 * What stays here is what every gate shares: the access predicate
 * (`hasPremiumAccess`), the reason enum and its billing-aware refinement, and
 * the CTA action resolver. Gate modules import from this file; it imports from
 * none of them, so the dependency runs one way.
