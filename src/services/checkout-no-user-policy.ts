/**
 * Pure policy decision for the signed-out branch of startCheckout().
 *
 * The contract that this function encodes — and that
 * `tests/checkout-no-user-policy.test.mts` regresses against — is:
 *
 *   fallbackToPricingPage = true  → fire-and-forget redirect to /pro,
 *                                   DO NOT persist sessionStorage state.
 *                                   /pro owns its own URL-param intent
 *                                   lifecycle; saving here would create
 *                                   a stale dashboard-side intent that a
 *                                   future unrelated sign-in would auto-
 *                                   resume into a phantom checkout.
 *
 *   fallbackToPricingPage = false → inline openSignIn() in the dashboard;
 *                                   persist pending + attempt so the
 *                                   post-auth Clerk listener can resume
 *                                   the exact checkout the user clicked.
 *
 * Extracted so callers' wiring (the actual persistence calls + redirect /
 * sign-in invocations) is testable without spinning up the full
 * checkout.ts dependency tree (Clerk, Dodo SDK, Convex).

/**
 * Executes the signed-out branch: WHICH effects run, and in WHAT ORDER.
 *
 * The decision above is pure, but for #5380-High-3 that was not enough — the
 * ordering and the "redirect must not persist" contract lived only in
 * `checkout.ts`'s inline if/else, where no test could reach them. Two
 * mutations proved it: persisting inside the redirect branch, and moving
 * `openSignIn()` above the persist calls, each restored a real bug with the
 * suite green.
 *
 * Keeping the sequencing here (rather than a source-grep guard over
 * `checkout.ts`) makes both mutations executable failures: the caller is
 * reduced to a handler literal that binds each effect to its implementation.
 * Persisting BEFORE `openSignIn()` is load-bearing — Clerk's post-auth
 * listener fires as soon as sign-in resolves and reads the pending intent.
