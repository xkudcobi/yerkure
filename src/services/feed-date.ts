/**
 * Feed-date parsing + the single ranking/recency helper consumers must use
 * for any "is this item fresh?" decision.
 *
 * Background: RSS 2.0 makes `pubDate` optional; Atom uses `<updated>` and
 * `<published>` separately. Real feeds frequently ship items with missing
 * or malformed timestamps. The legacy `parseFeedDateOrNow` substituted
 * `Date.now()` for any unparseable input — that produced FALSE FRESHNESS:
 * an item with no real date would sort ahead of legitimately fresh items
 * and fire breaking-news alerts that shouldn't fire.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - `parseFeedDate(value)` returns `{ date, missing }`. The Date is still
 *     populated (using `Date.now()` as the synthesized stamp) so display
 *     consumers can format it without null-handling. The `missing` flag
 *     records whether the source had a parseable timestamp.
 *   - `effectivePubDateMs(item)` returns 0 for items with `pubDateMissing:
 *     true`, otherwise `item.pubDate.getTime()`. Every ranking/recency
 *     consumer in `src/services/` and `src/app/` MUST route through this
 *     helper instead of calling `item.pubDate.getTime()` directly. The
 *     static guardrail test `tests/feed-date-ranking-uses-effective.test.
 *     mts` enforces this.
 *
 * Recency-window semantics: returning 0 makes any positive-duration
 * recency gate (`Date.now() - effectivePubDateMs(item) < windowMs`)
 * evaluate false, which EXCLUDES missing-date items from freshness
 * windows. They remain in the underlying catalog and render normally with
 * the synthesized timestamp; they just never claim to be fresh. This is
 * the deliberate trade-off — see plan U3 Key Technical Decisions.

 * set it.
 *
 * Implementation lives in shared/news-clustering-core.js (issue #5697): the

 * must agree. Re-exported here so every existing ranking consumer keeps its
