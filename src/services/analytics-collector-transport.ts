/**
 * Transport layer for Umami collector writes (`POST /api/send`).
 *
 * Umami v3.1.0 has a race in `prisma.sessionData.updateMany()`
 * (umami-software/umami#4183) that returns HTTP 500 for a few percent of
 * requests when a page issues concurrent writes for one session. This module
 * serializes our writes through a single in-flight slot so we stop generating
 * that contention ourselves, and turns the tracker's swallowed failures into an
 * observable delivery signal.
 *
 * Two invariants keep this from becoming a worse failure than the one it fixes:
 *
 *  1. The gate is installed EXACTLY ONCE. It must never re-wrap `window.fetch`
 *     after some other instrumentation (Sentry's breadcrumbs/tracing
 *     integrations, the wm-session interceptor, the desktop runtime patch) has
 *     wrapped it. A second gate delegates through the first, and because both
 *     share this module's queue the inner call blocks on `inFlight` while the
 *     outer awaits it — a permanent deadlock that silently stops all analytics
 *     for the page. Installing once is safe: a later wrapper delegates down to
 *     us, so we still see every collector write.
 *  2. Every dispatch is time-bounded on BOTH sides. The single slot means one
 *     hung request would otherwise wedge every subsequent write for the page's
 *     lifetime. An abort signal alone does not buy that: it bounds the request
 *     only if the transport underneath honors it, and `window.fetch` on this
 *     page is routinely wrapped by third-party instrumentation that does not.
 *     So the slot is released on a deadline this module owns, raced against the
 *     awaited response — see `withCollectorDeadline` and `CollectorFailure.raced`.

   * transport observed our abort and settled, so nothing is left on the wire.
   * With it, the request was never cancelled — a wrapper that discarded
   * `init.signal` is still holding it, and it may yet commit.
   *
   * KNOWN LIMITATION: this is a timing inference, not a fact reported by the
   * transport. `LATCH_RELEASE_GRACE_MS` makes a false positive unlikely, not
   * impossible — and #6968 pauses the latch while the tab is hidden so a
   * frozen WebKit fetch is no longer the main source of that false positive.
   * A hidden tab under intensive timer throttling can still leave the abort
   * and the latch due in one wake-up if both fire after the tab returns, and
   * a cleanly-cancelled write would then be marked `raced` and lose both its
   * retry and its durable marker. The inverse (a genuinely outstanding

   * `botFiltered`, it is read in two categories of place, and both are

   *
   *  - RE-SEND (the reason the marker exists): `isRetryableCollectorFailure`
   *    and the durable checkout marker in `analytics.ts` both refuse to replay
   *    it, because re-sending an append-only conversion whose original may
   *    still commit double-counts it. `isRetryableIdentityFailure` still
   *    replays — an idempotent overwrite has no such hazard.
   *  - ALERTING: it is exempt from the environment-noise floors, skips the
   *    once-per-cohort noise latch, reports without waiting on the cross-user
   *    aggregate's verdict, and carries its own Sentry fingerprint segment.
   *    Not gold-plating — this fix REMOVES `queue-overflow`, the parked page's
   *    only other symptom, so without these the population goes dark exactly
   *    when the bug is fixed (#6288).

 * and therefore indistinguishable in Sentry from a genuine api.worldmonitor.app

 * re-partitioned the `window.fetch` trampolines into a different chunk, and the
 * chunk that carries them now also carries `runtime.ts`, so no widening of that
 * allowlist can stay safe. Naming the rejection at its source is the stable
 * form of the same intent: one exact string, from one line, for one condition.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT change is WHICH outcomes reject. An HTTP error
 * still resolves with the real Response (see `runCollectorRequest`) — only a
 * network-layer failure ever reaches this wrapper — so the native-fetch
 * semantics the tracker expects are preserved and only the rejection's identity
 * moves. Scope is bounded to classified collector writes: the pass-through
 * branches in `installCollectorFetchGate` hand app fetches the untouched
 * original promise, so no first-party request can acquire this wrapper.
 *
 * The original error is retained on `cause` so failure classification stays
 * exact — `collectorFailureFromError` unwraps it rather than flattening every
 * wrapped timeout into `network`. A class-field write after `super()` throws

    // Scoped to `network` because that is the whole ambiguity: the raw error

    // AbortController and must come back identity-equal — a contract the
    // compatibility suite asserts with `error === reason`
    // (tests/analytics-beacon-rejection.test.mts). It also needs no attribution:
    // the caller already knows why it aborted. Detected by identity rather than
    // by shape, because a caller reason is an arbitrary value that classifies as
    // `network` like anything else unrecognised.
