/**
 * Post-checkout entitlement wait for the checkout-success banner.
 *
 * The buyer lands here straight back from Dodo's HOSTED checkout, so the page
 * is a cold load: Clerk must hydrate, then Convex must authenticate, then the
 * entitlement subscription must deliver. That whole chain is what this state
 * machine is waiting on.
 *
 * WORLDMONITOR-PZ / #6760 is what it is shaped around. The first version
 * subscribed to `onEntitlementChange` and nothing else, then tore the
 * subscription down at the deadline. Production showed that losing all three
 * bets at once is routine: of the timeout events carrying a Clerk id, three
 * users held an ACTIVE `pro_monthly` whose subscription period had already
 * started BEFORE Sentry recorded the timeout — one of them 2 m 19 s before. The
 * money and the entitlement were right; only the banner was wrong.
 *
 * So the wait now settles on three independent signals rather than one:
 *
 *  1. A change event (the fast path, unchanged).
 *  2. A POLL of `isEntitled()`. A change event only fires on a TRANSITION the
 *     page observed. An entitlement that was already true when the
 *     subscription finally authenticated produces no transition at all, and the
 *     event-only wait waits forever. This is the same late-hydration bet the
 *     email watcher in `checkout.ts` already hedges by polling Clerk.
 *  3. A RE-CHECK at the deadline, before any failure is announced. Cheap, and
 *     it is the single case the production data showed most often.
 *
 * And a deadline is no longer terminal: the wait keeps watching for
 * `lateGraceMs` afterwards, so a genuinely slow activation still flips the
 * banner back to `active` instead of stranding the buyer on a failure message
 * until they reload.
 *
 * Shape: pure DI module. Entitlement access and every timer are injected so the
 * state machine is testable without a DOM, a network, or `checkout.ts`'s
 * browser UI dependency graph.
 *
 * See tests/checkout-entitlement-wait.test.mts.
