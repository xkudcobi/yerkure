import type { Feed } from '@/types';

/**
 * Whether a feed is fetchable in a given UI language.
 *
 * A feed with no explicit `lang` is universal (or multi-URL, resolved per
 * language inside `fetchFeed`). A feed that declares one is only fetched when
 * it matches — unless it is a `strategicDefault`, which bypasses the language
 * filter so it is reachable in every locale.
 *
 * A strategic-default feed carries local-depth content on a strategically
 * important topic (active war, frontline NATO state, Tier-1 Indo-Pacific
 * flashpoint) that should be visible to every user regardless of UI language.
 *
 * Extracted so callers that must reason about a category's REACHABLE feed set
 * share this rule rather than restating it. Custom news categories rotate a
 * capped window through their sources and report the resulting coverage on the
 * panel badge (#5873), and both are wrong if they count feeds the fetch will
 * silently discard: `europe` declares 47 feeds but only 6 are fetchable for an
 * English user, so rotating over all 47 would spend roughly seven of every
 * eight twenty-minute cycles fetching nothing, and the badge would sit at
 * "6/47 sources" permanently — a fresh version of the same lie #5873 is about.
 *
 * The language is a parameter rather than read from i18n here so this stays a
 * pure, unit-testable rule; callers pass `getCurrentLanguage()`.
