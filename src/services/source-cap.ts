// Free-tier source-cap distribution.
//
// Replaces the prior alphabetical-slice enforcement that silently auto-disabled
// every source past position N in a sorted list — which catastrophically broke
// late-alphabet categories. With FREE_MAX_SOURCES=80 and ~30 categories, the
// alphabetical strategy left entire categories ('Layoffs', 'Semiconductors &
// Hardware', 'IPO & SPAC', 'Funding & VC', 'Product Hunt', etc.) with ALL
// their sources auto-disabled, producing the "All sources disabled" red panel
// state on the homepage with no user explanation.
//
// New strategy: round-robin across category buckets so the cap is spent
// fairly. Every category with at least one enabled-eligible source keeps at
// least one slot until the cap is exhausted. Within a category, sources are
// taken in `feeds.ts` declaration order — editorial team controls "primary"
// by listing the most important source first.
