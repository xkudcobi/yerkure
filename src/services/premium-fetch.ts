/**
 * Fetch wrapper for premium RPC clients.
 *
 * Injects a Clerk Bearer token (or WORLDMONITOR_API_KEY as fallback) directly
 * into every request for premium endpoints. This is the source-of-truth auth
 * injection for those routes — no reliance on the global fetch patch.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — Bearer injection is path-gated to PREMIUM_RPC_PATHS only.
 * Many service clients (economic, supply-chain, …) wrap the WHOLE generated
 * client with `premiumFetch` even though only a few of its methods target
 * a premium path. For non-premium methods (FRED batch, BLS batch, BIS,
 * energy, etc.) attaching `Authorization: Bearer …` actively harmed Pro
 * users with no tester key:
 *
 *   1. premiumFetch sets Authorization → wm-session interceptor sees it
 *      and steps aside (no `X-WorldMonitor-Key: wms_…` is attached).
 *   2. Server gateway only resolves Bearer JWTs on tier-gated paths
 *      (gateway.ts: `if (isTierGated) resolveClerkSession(...)`); for
 *      non-tier-gated paths the JWT is ignored entirely.
 *   3. api/_api-key.js `validateApiKey()` reads ONLY X-WorldMonitor-Key.
 *      With no key present it returns { valid: false, required: true } →
 *      gateway emits 401.
 *
 * Net effect: Pro users without a tester session got 401s on FRED + BLS + BIS etc., while anon users (whose
 * premiumFetch falls through to globalThis.fetch and the interceptor
 * attaches wms_) saw the data normally — the inverse of the expected
 * "Pro sees more" behaviour.
 *
 * Fix: don't attach Bearer for non-premium paths. Fall through to the
 * unauth path so the wm-session interceptor handles the wms_ attach.
 * API-key holders (step 1) and tester-key holders (step 2) are unaffected
 * — those keys travel via X-WorldMonitor-Key which works on any path.

 * nor PREMIUM_RPC_PATHS, and those callers never reach `premiumFetch`. Retrying
 * here as well would double the bound to two attempts and ~10s of inline wait.
 *
 * Reporting the FINAL response is still the point, and still works: the patch
 * resolves to the post-retry response, so a transient it absorbs produces no
 * Sentry event at all — matching how the two other expected-transient 503s on
 * this path are handled (see reportServerError) — while a sustained outage
 * still yields exactly one event per call, so the origin-5xx canary keeps its
