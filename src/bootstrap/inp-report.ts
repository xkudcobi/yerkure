/**
 * Field INP attribution reporting (#4537).
 *
 * `reportInpMetric` shapes one web-vitals INP measurement (attribution build)
 * into a Sentry event and routes it through `enqueueSentryCall` so it survives
 * Sentry's deferred (~10s idle) init: the call buffers and drains on init
 * rather than being dropped because the SDK hasn't loaded when the interaction
 * occurs. Reporting interaction target + the three INP sub-parts lets us see
 * which real interaction is slow and whether the cost is input delay,
 * processing, or presentation — the data that drives fix prioritization.
 * Good-rated events are trimmed (#4565), so captured-event p75 is conditioned
 * on the bad tail. Verify fixes with bad-event rate per formFactor plus
 * weekly page-level CrUX queryHistoryRecord, not p75 of captured Sentry events.
 *
 * The `onINP` registration that calls this lives behind the `web-vitals`
 * dependency (see `registerInpReporting` doc at the bottom). This module keeps
 * the reportable logic free of that import so it builds and is unit-tested
 * without the package present.
