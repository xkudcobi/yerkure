/**
 * Bounds how many HTML markers the 3D globe renders at once (#5368).
 *
 * globe.gl renders `htmlElementsData` through three's CSS2DRenderer, which walks
 * EVERY marker on EVERY animation frame and rewrites `display`, `transform` and
 * `zIndex` on each one — unconditionally, even with a still camera — then runs a
 * whole-scene `traverseVisible` plus an O(n log n) depth sort
 * (three/examples/jsm/renderers/CSS2DRenderer.js:214-310, driven from
 * globe.gl's `_animationCycle`). Frame cost is therefore linear in marker count
 * and lands squarely in the interaction frame budget, which is what INP measures.
 *
 * Measured on production 2026-07-18: the desktop default view carries 2,319
 * markers, 1,526 of them live AIS vessels arriving over a websocket with no
 * ceiling of their own; opting into Armed Conflict Events adds a further 2,000.
 * Nothing upstream bounds these, so the ceiling belongs here.
 *
 * This module is deliberately free of DOM and three.js imports so the real
 * selection function can be unit-tested directly against real payload shapes.
 *
 * It is shared with the SVG/D3 renderer (`MapComponent.renderOverlays`), which
 * has the same shape of problem for a different reason (#7112) — see
 * `MAP_OVERLAY_MARKER_BUDGET_DESKTOP` below. The names keep the `Globe` prefix
 * they were introduced with; the selection itself is renderer-agnostic.

 * and, through the rebuild churn, the renderer's detached-node count.

 * Measured on production 2026-08-24, desktop viewport, default layers, SVG
