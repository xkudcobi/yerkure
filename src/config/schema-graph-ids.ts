/**
 * Canonical JSON-LD entity identifiers and the property values that travel
 * with them (#7459, #7611).
 *
 * The entity graph only folds together if every producer spells these `@id`
 * values identically, so the TypeScript producers share them from here rather
 * than each declaring their own literal. Static HTML entries (index.html,
 * pro-test/*.html), the separate Astro blog build, and the .mjs corpus
 * generators cannot import this module and carry their own copies; the schema
 * contract tests in tests/schema-graph-contract.test.mts are what keep those in
 * step.
 *
 * Pinning `@id` alone was not enough. Three surfaces each built their own node
 * body under the shared `#software` identity, so a consumer merging by `@id`
 * received two `applicationCategory` values for one entity (#7611). The
 * `*_SHARED_PROPERTIES` literals below are therefore the single source of truth
 * for the properties that must not diverge, and the contract test asserts every
 * emitting surface reproduces them exactly.

 * Property VALUES every `#software` emitter must assert identically.

 * `SoftwareApplication` rather than `WebApplication`: the product also ships
 * desktop builds and an Android TV app, which the narrower subtype would
 * misdescribe, and /schemamap.xml already advertises the supertype.
 * `BusinessApplication` rather than the FinanceApplication / SecurityApplication
 * split it replaces: Yerküre is neither a finance app nor a security app.
 *
 * This pins the values the product decision turns on. It is deliberately NOT
 * the whole guard — enumerating properties would only freeze the ones that
 * happened to be wrong, and the invariant is "one `@id`, one body". The
 * contract test therefore also asserts that every property two emitters both
 * carry agrees, pinned or not, exempting only the union-mergeable ones
 * (`alternateName`, `keywords`, `offers`, `featureList` — the last rewritten
 * per variant by variant-dashboard-html.ts).
