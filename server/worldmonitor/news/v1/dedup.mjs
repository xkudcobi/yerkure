/**
 * Cluster a request batch of feed items into stories and assign each item
 * its cluster's canonical identity (#4919). Replaces the exact
 * sha256(normalizeTitle) identity that forked a story on ANY wording edit
 * and deflated corroboration to verbatim-syndication-only.
 *
 * Canonical id = hash of the normalized title of the EARLIEST-published
 * member (ties and missing timestamps fall back to the lexicographically
 * smallest normalized title). Anchoring on the oldest member keeps the
 * story:track identity stable while a story actively corroborates: a
 * newly-joining wording, by definition, publishes later and therefore can
 * never steal the canonical mid-lifecycle (PR #4924 review — reliability
 * P1 + the 3-incident story:track continuity history in
 * list-feed-digest.ts). The id changes only when the oldest member ages
 * out of the 96h window — the same orphaning every wording variant
 * suffered under exact hashing, so worst case equals old behavior.
 * publishedAt is publisher-controlled, so a hostile feed can backdate
 * inside the freshness window to win this comparison (#4925 item 1). That
 * is why the batch-derived canonical is only a DEFAULT: the caller passes
 * it through adoptExistingCanonical, which prefers server-side Redis state
 * a feed cannot fake.
 *
 * Items whose normalized title is EMPTY (emoji/punctuation-only) get a
 * per-item sentinel identity instead of sharing sha256("") — under exact
 * hashing all such items accumulated one phantom story:track row with
 * pooled corroboration.
 *
 * @template {{ title: string; source: string; originPublisher?: string; originPublisherTrusted?: boolean; publishedAt?: number }} T
 * @param {T[]} items

 *   unchanged for singleton clusters)

/**
 * Pure canonical-adoption rule (#4924 review P1, extended by #4925 item 1).
 * Given a cluster's member exact-title hashes, the batch-derived default
 * canonical hash, a map of live alias rows (memberHash -> canonical hash
 * written in a previous cycle, same TTL as story tracks) and a map of live
 * story:track first-seen stamps, return the hash the cluster should track
 * under. Three rules, in order:
 *
 *   1. The OLDEST member hash that already anchors a live story:track row,
 *      except when that member has a live alias to a different canonical.
 *      Such a track is superseded by the alias and must not re-seize the
 *      story before rule 2 can preserve the aliased identity. firstSeen is
 *      HSETNX'd by the digest at first observation, so it is server-side
 *      state a feed cannot fake — unlike publishedAt, which decides the
 *      batch-derived default and is publisher-controlled. This is what stops
 *      a feed that backdates inside the freshness window from seizing a live
 *      story's identity, and what stops an attacker who can place several
 *      member hashes in the cluster from out-voting the genuine story under
 *      rule 2 (#4925 item 1).
 *   2. Otherwise the live canonical most of the members already point at,
 *      so a story keeps its identity when the original canonical member
 *      drops out of the batch (#4924). Rule 1 cannot cover this case: a
 *      canonical absent from the batch is not one of the member hashes, so
 *      it has no track row to find here.
 *   3. Otherwise the batch-derived default.
 *
 * Deterministic throughout: oldest firstSeen wins, then most-common alias
 * target wins, and both tie-break to the lexicographically smallest hash.
 *
 * Stays pure — the caller owns the Redis reads and decides which track rows
 * count as live.
