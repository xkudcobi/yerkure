/**
 * The structured half of GetCountryCoverage (#7526).
 *
 * The country panel reconciles its news coverage against five first-party
 * caches it already holds in the browser. This module reads the same five on
 * the server and shapes them into the same `CountryTimelineIncident` records,
 * so `reconcileCountryTimelineIncidents` can give a structured record precedence
 * over the news reprint that describes it.
 *
 * Every producer reports its own state. A producer that failed, or that this
 * surface cannot reach at all, is never allowed to look like a quiet one — an
 * agent reading `events: []` must be able to tell "nothing happened" from
 * "the protest seeder is down".
 *
 * Containment: the browser tests the loaded country polygon and falls back to a
 * hand-tuned box; the server has no polygon, so it uses the generated
 * shared/country-bboxes.js box for every country. That is reported to the
 * caller in the response's `containment` field rather than hidden. Recognized
 * protest country labels take precedence over this approximate geometry.
