// v12 bump for PR 3A §net-imports denominator (plan

// prefix bump v11 entries would serve stale pre-fix scores for the
// full 6h TTL post-deploy. v12 forces a clean slate — matches the
// established v9→v10 and v10→v11 patterns for formula-affecting
// deploys. v12→v13 bump in plan 2026-04-25-004 Phase 1 (Ship 1) for the
// `tradeSanctions` → `tradePolicy` rename + dropped OFAC component +
// reweighted trade-policy formula. Without the bump, v12 entries would
// serve pre-rename economic-domain scores for the full 6h TTL post-deploy.
// v13→v14 bump in plan 2026-04-25-004 Phase 2 (Ship 2) for the new
// `financialSystemExposure` dim — adds a 20th dimension contributing to
// the economic domain, so v13 entries (which lack the new dim's score)
// would surface incomplete payloads on cache hit.
// v15→v16 bump for plan 2026-04-26-002 §U4+U5+U6 (combined PR 3+4+5):
// imputed dims now contribute 0.5× nominal weight to the
// coverage-weighted mean (U4); IMPUTE entries fall back to "unknown"
// (50/0.3) instead of "stable-absence" (85/0.6) for non-comprehensive
// sources (U5); event-counted dims (socialCohesion unrest, borderSecurity
// UCDP) normalize per-million-population (U6). Every country's score
// shifts; mixing v15 + v16 cached scores in the same response would
// create internally-inconsistent rankings.
// v16→v17 bump for plan 2026-04-26-002 §U7 (PR 6): `headlineEligible`
// flips from PR 2's "true everywhere" to actual eligibility logic
// (coverage >= 0.65 AND (population >= 200k OR coverage >= 0.85) AND
// !lowConfidence). Cached v16 score entries carry headlineEligible:true
// for every country (the PR 2 default), which would let ineligible
// countries through the headline ranking filter for the full 6h TTL
// post-deploy. Bump forces a clean recompute aligned with the new gate.
// v17→v18 bump for plan 2026-04-26-002 §U8.1 (net-imports denominator
// extended from sovereignFiscalBuffer to liquidReserveAdequacy). The
// `_formula` tag is binary 'd6'|'pc' and does NOT detect intra-'d6'
// scorer-formula changes — without this bump, cached v17 AE/PA scores
// (gross-imports-denominated) would continue to serve for the full 6h
// TTL post-deploy, defeating the construct fix this PR delivers. Same
// pattern as the v11→v12 bump that PR 3A used for the SWF-side fix.
// v18→v19 bump for issue #3971: cyberDigital now caps the per-snapshot
// severity-weighted cyber threat count before normalization. The `_formula`
// tag does not distinguish intra-formula scorer changes, so cached v18
// scores would otherwise serve pre-cap cyberDigital values until TTL.
// v19→v20 bump for country-resilience audit P1-3: freshness/staleness
// now derates confidence coverage and therefore can change lowConfidence
// plus headlineEligible. Scores are unchanged, but cached v19 score
// payloads already carry the old confidence/eligibility booleans.
// v20→v21 bump for the P1-1 CRI contract fix: pillar member domains now
// use domain.weight * average dimension coverage inside the active `pc`
// formula. The `_formula` tag remains `pc`, so the prefix bump is required
// to reject old same-tag pillar scores deterministically at deploy. v20 is
// reserved for the parallel staleness-derate rollout, so this branch sequences
// the next same-tag `pc` formula change into v21.
// v21→v22 bump for country-resilience audit round 2 P2-N2/P2-N3:
// currencyExternal now scores inflation stability around a low-positive target
// band instead of treating deflation/0% inflation as perfect, and blend math
// rejects NaN scores rather than consuming their weights.
// v22→v23 bump batches three same-tag `pc` scorer changes: import-HHI stale /
// missing source years now derate certainty coverage (#4088), infrastructure
// treats an observed outage feed with zero outages as observed-quiet (score 100)
// matching cyberDigital (P3-8), and WTO tradePolicy restriction/barrier rows now
// score one-row-per-reporter severity instead of stale count anchors (P2-1).
// Same `pc` formula tag, but recovery, infrastructure, tradePolicy, pillar, and
// overall scores can move.
// v23→v24 bump for country-resilience audit round 5 R5-2 / PR #4101:
// governance WGI indicator slots now preserve each WGI series as its own
// signal instead of relying on drift-prone slot semantics. The formula tag is
// still `pc`, but governance, state-continuity, pillar, and overall payloads can
// move, so cached score entries must not survive the methodology change.
// v24→v25 bump for issue #4009: cyberDigital now groups cyber threats by
// stable firstSeenAt discovery day and decays old one-day bursts while
// allowing sustained multi-day pressure to reach the cap. Same `pc` formula
// tag, but infrastructure, pillar, and overall payloads can move.
// v25→v26 bump (2026-08-10) for the serialized `education` dimension. The
// flag-off triple-zero placeholder is excluded from domain, pillar, and
// confidence denominators, so numeric scores do not move. The score namespace
// still rotates because old cached score payloads do not contain the new
// dimension row.
// v27→v28 bump (2026-08-13, #6511) for the live
// `financialSystemExposure` activation. The dimension was flag-dark while
// v27 was published; keeping that namespace would mix education-only scores
// with the finance-on construct after the production flip.

// v12→v13 bump in lockstep with RESILIENCE_SCORE_CACHE_PREFIX v17→v18
// for plan 2026-04-26-002 §U8.1 (liquidReserveAdequacy net-imports).
// Pre-bump history points for AE and PA were written against the

// v13→v14 bump in lockstep with RESILIENCE_SCORE_CACHE_PREFIX v18→v19

//      `setCachedJson` only logs and swallows on error, which would make a
//      transient /set failure look like a successful warm and publish a
//      ranking aggregate over missing per-country keys.
//
// The pipeline SET response is the authoritative persistence signal: it's
// synchronous with the write, so "result: OK" per command means the key is

// pipeline, and only include countries whose SET returned OK in the returned
// map. Callers should merge the map directly into their local `cachedScores`
