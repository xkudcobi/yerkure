/**
 * RPC: ListMarketQuotes -- seed-first stock/index quotes.
 *
 * The fixed Railway seed snapshot (`market:stocks-bootstrap:v1`, written by
 * scripts/ais-relay.cjs and scripts/seed-market-quotes.mjs) answers the default
 * symbol universe with no upstream call at all. Only symbols the snapshot does
 * not carry — the user's custom watchlist tickers, which the picker resolved
 * through Finnhub search, plus any default the seeder dropped this cycle —
 * reach a provider, through a bounded, Redis-cached gap fetch (#6305). Every
 * requested symbol that produces no quote comes back in `unavailable` with a
 * reason; none is silently dropped.
 *
 * Bounds, all deliberate and all tested:
 *   - MARKET_QUOTES_REQUEST_LIMIT  symbols accepted per request
 *   - MARKET_QUOTES_UPSTREAM_LIMIT provider lookups attempted per request
 *   - UPSTREAM_CONCURRENCY         provider lookups in flight at once
 *   - UPSTREAM_DEADLINE_MS         wall-clock budget for the whole gap fetch
 *   - QUOTE_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_MS    per-symbol upstream timeout
 *
 * A transient provider failure is never cached; only a definitive "this symbol
 * does not exist" is, and only for QUOTE_NEGATIVE_TTL_SECONDS. A seed read that
 * misses or fails never falls through to the provider — that would turn one
 * degraded snapshot into a per-caller fan-out of every requested symbol.
 *
 * The route carries an explicit fail-closed endpoint rate policy
 * (`server/_shared/rate-limit.ts`) because it is now provider-backed.

 * `remainingMs` made it expire on the same tick as the deadline, and Node ran
 * whichever timer its queue happened to order first: when the backstop won, the

 *   - `remainingMs <= QUOTE_PROVIDER_CALL_BUDGET_MS` — the deadline binds, so
 *     the backstop sits a grace *later* and the deadline always cuts first.
 *   - `remainingMs >  QUOTE_PROVIDER_CALL_BUDGET_MS` — the call budget binds,
 *     so the backstop fires *earlier*, on its own, well before the deadline.
 * Neither branch can return `remainingMs`, so no window ties. The obvious
 * `Math.min(BUDGET, remainingMs) + GRACE` spelling does not hold this: it ties
 * at exactly `BUDGET + GRACE`, a window a lane reaches whenever it starts a
 * lookup `GRACE`ms into a request.
 *
 * A cutoff in the second regime is still reported as the provider's — see
 * `classifyGapFetchFailure`, which only charges the budget at the deadline.

 * The deadline test stays *ahead* of `recorded` on purpose: an abort makes the
 * provider adapter's own fetch reject, which it reports as `status: 'error'`.
 * That entry describes our cutoff, not the provider, so it must not win here.
 * Within the window `recorded` is the provider's real verdict and is used as-is;
 * a failure with no verdict at all is still charged to the provider.
 *
 * One consequence, unchanged in kind from the abort-only precedence this
 * replaces: a `rate_limited` verdict landing in the same millisecond as the
 * deadline reads as budget, so it does not raise the response-level
 * `rateLimited` flag. At that instant we are out of budget either way, and the
