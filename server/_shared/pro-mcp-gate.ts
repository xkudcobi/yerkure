/**
 * The Pro-MCP access decision, shared by the five entitlement gates listed below.
 *
 * Five call sites previously re-implemented the same four-clause check
 * (`tier >= 1 && mcpAccess === true && validUntil >= now`, plus the null case):
 *
 *   - `api/internal/mcp-grant-context.ts` — renders the consent card
 *   - `api/internal/mcp-grant-mint.ts`    — mints the signed grant
 *   - `api/oauth/authorize-pro.ts`        — finishes authorization on the
 *                                          api subdomain
 *   - `api/mcp/auth.ts`                   — protects MCP-edge requests
 *   - `server/gateway.ts`                 — re-checks signed internal MCP calls
 *
 * The decision lives here so the OAuth handshake cannot authorize an account
 * that the MCP edge or gateway later rejects. Each caller keeps its own response
 * envelope and telemetry (#5622, #5653).
 *
 * What this module owns, precisely: the ACCESS decision, for all five. The
 * `ProMcpGateDenial` union is consumed as a rendered decision only by the three
 * grant-flow callers (via `proMcpGateDenialResponse`). `api/mcp/auth.ts` and
 * `server/gateway.ts` read the return value as pass/deny and render billing
 * denials through their own helpers — which bottom out in the same
 * `entitlement-check.ts::classifyBillingVerification`. That function, not this
 * one, is the single source for billing classification.
 *
 * Coverage validity is shared with the premium resolver and gateway through
 * `hasCurrentEntitlementCoverage`. Convex token issuance retains its own check
 * because the Convex runtime does not import from `server/_shared`.

 * travels, in `X-Billing-Verification` and `error_description`, for monitoring
 * and support — it just does not fork the SPA's control flow three ways.
 *
 * `checkProMcpAccess` normally reclassifies a provider-confirmed lapse to
 * `free_account`, so the handshake callers do not render a denial for it. The
 * non-retryable billing branch below remains defensive for an explicitly
