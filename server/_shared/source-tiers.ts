/**
 * Source tier system for news feed prioritization.
 *
 * Canonical RSS data: shared/source-tiers.json — loaded here via
 * resolveJsonModule (for Vercel edge + the main relay container) and by
 * scripts/ais-relay.cjs via requireShared('source-tiers.json').
 * `requireShared()` resolves from
 * `../shared` OR `./shared` depending on packaging root, so Railway services
 * using rootDirectory=scripts (which cannot see repo-root shared/) pick up
 * scripts/shared/source-tiers.json — a byte-identical mirror enforced by
 * tests/edge-functions.test.mjs (`scripts/shared/ stays in sync with shared/`).
 * Byte-identity is also cross-checked by tests/importance-score-parity.test.mjs.
 * Telegram and X tiers are additive typed overlays. Keeping them out of the RSS
 * JSON makes their registries mechanically testable and prevents renamed
 * channels or accounts from leaving stale public tier keys.
 *
 * Tier 1: Wire services / official gov/intl orgs — fastest, most authoritative
 * Tier 2: Major established outlets — high-quality journalism
 * Tier 3: Specialty / regional / think tank sources — domain expertise
 * Tier 4: Aggregators and blogs — useful but less authoritative
