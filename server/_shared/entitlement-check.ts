 * Entitlement enforcement middleware for the Vercel API gateway.
 *
 * Reads cached entitlements from Redis (raw keys, no deployment prefix) with
 * Convex fallback on cache miss. Returns a 403 Response for tier-gated endpoints
 * when the user lacks the required tier.
 *
 * Fail-closed behavior of checkEntitlement():
 *   - No userId header on a gated endpoint -> 403 (authentication required)
 *   - Redis miss + Convex failure -> 403 (unable to verify entitlements)
 *   - Endpoint not in ENDPOINT_ENTITLEMENTS -> allow (unrestricted)
 *
 * A lookup that was attempted but produced no answer — Redis/Convex failure,
 * Convex 5xx, or a Convex 4xx that means our own credential is wrong — returns a
 * verificationUnavailable marker so callers answer with a retryable 503 instead
 * of a misleading hard denial. A null from getEntitlements means either that no
 * lookup was attempted (backend unconfigured) or that Convex confirmed the user
 * has no entitlement. wm_ user-key gateway traffic fails closed on null in both
 * cases: callers get a retryable 503 with code
 * entitlement_verification_unavailable, including when the entitlement backend
 * is wholly unconfigured.
 *
 * classifyBillingVerification() is the single decision point for that denial;
 * getBillingVerificationDenial() renders it as JSON, and the HTML / OAuth-grant
 * / boolean-premium surfaces render the same decision in their own vocabulary
 * (#5622). A transient answer is negative-cached in-process for a few seconds so
 * a backend outage costs one lookup per user per window, not one per request.

      // API-tier entry written before the shared-budget marker carries the old
      // numeric 1,000/10,000, which satisfies both checks above and resolves
      // `{allowance: 'mcp'}` — same counter and same ceiling as the correct
      // `{allowance: 'api', counter: 'mcp'}`, but one unit per call instead of
      // the per-tool weight, so those callers under-pay until the entry ages
      // out. No paid plan legitimately pairs `apiAccess` with a NUMERIC
