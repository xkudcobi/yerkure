/**
 * Query-side embedding for the historical intelligence memory (#5694).
 *
 * Split out of intel-history-client.ts: turning free text into a vector is a
 * different upstream (a paid embeddings provider), a different failure mode,
 * and a different budget than reading the Convex store — and it is the half
 * that grows when the embedding model is versioned (#5742).
 *
 * EDGE-RUNTIME CONSTRAINT — the embedding call is reimplemented here rather
 * than reusing `embedBatch` from scripts/lib/brief-embedding.mjs. That module
 * imports `node:crypto` for its cache keys, and the intelligence gateway
 * (api/intelligence/v1/[rpc].ts) runs on the Vercel Edge runtime, which
 * rejects node: built-ins at runtime. Only the pure, dependency-free modules
 * are imported: the tunables that must not drift from the seed writer's, and
 * the outlet-suffix stripper that is half the normalization contract. The
 * other half (`normalizeQueryText`) is re-derived, and
 * tests/intel-history-endpoints.test.mts asserts it against the real
 * `normalizeForEmbedding` so the copy cannot drift silently.
