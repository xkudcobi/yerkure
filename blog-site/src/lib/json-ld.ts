/**
 * The single serialisation seam for every JSON-LD block blog-site emits.
 *
 * blog-site is a separate live JSON-LD emitter from the crawlable corpus: the
 * #7502 sweep in tests/crawlable-corpus.test.mjs walks built corpus output and
 * asserts a resolvable `@context` on every block, and `use-cases` / `research`
 * ride along only because buildCrawlableCorpus writes them into the same
 * outDir. Nothing covered blog-site, whose eleven producers each hand-wrote
 * their own `"@context": "https://schema.org"` — so a block that simply omitted
 * it would have shipped silently and been ignored by every consumer (#7530).
 *
 * Every producer now passes through here, and a missing or unresolvable
 * `@context` is stamped rather than published broken. Blocks that legitimately
 * carry a richer context (an array, or an object with an `@vocab`) keep it.
