Country risk tools usually start with the question "how unstable is this country right now?" That is useful, but it is not the whole decision. A country can be under pressure and still absorb the shock. Another can look calm until a single outage, debt squeeze, or import disruption exposes how little capacity it has to recover.

WorldMonitor's Country Resilience Index is built for the second question:

> How well positioned is this country to absorb, adapt to, and recover from shocks?

The CRI is a 0-100 national resilience score for a public rankable country universe. It combines long-run structural capacity with current stress signals, then publishes the result through a methodology that exposes domains, coverage, and imputation context instead of hiding the model behind a black-box rating.

It complements the Country Instability Index, which is faster and more stress-oriented. CII asks where pressure is rising now. CRI asks which countries have the institutional, infrastructure, fiscal, health, energy, and recovery capacity to withstand pressure.

## What the CRI measures

The CRI measures national shock capacity at a point in time. It does not try to predict one specific crisis. It scores whether a country has the systems that make many shocks less damaging:

- macro and fiscal room
- currency and external buffers
- logistics, digital infrastructure, and cyber resilience
- energy-system security
- governance, social cohesion, conflict, and information conditions
- health, public service, food, and water resilience
- recovery capacity, including fiscal space, debt coverage, reserves, and import concentration

The live methodology uses 72 indicators across 21 active dimensions and 6 domains. Two structurally retired dimensions remain in the registry for schema continuity but do not carry active signal.

Every country is scored on a 0-100 scale. Higher is better. The score is not a GDP ranking, and the methodology deliberately avoids pure affluence proxies where the only thing they measure is "this country is rich." Indicators need to answer a mechanism question: what direct shock channel does this measure?

That mechanism test matters. Electricity access can be resilience-relevant when it captures grid collapse exposure. Per-capita electricity consumption can become a wealth proxy if it rewards consumption level rather than resilience. The CRI methodology has been repaired over time to separate those cases.

## The six domains

WorldMonitor groups indicators into six domains:

| Domain | What it captures |
|---|---|
| Economic | Macro-fiscal capacity, currency and external stability, trade policy, financial-system exposure |
| Infrastructure | Cyber and digital stress, logistics, public infrastructure, outages |
| Energy | Power-system security, low-carbon generation, imported fossil dependence, energy-price stress |
| Social and governance | Governance, social cohesion, conflict, displacement, information conditions |
| Health and food | Health service capacity, public-service continuity, food and water risk |
| Recovery | Fiscal space, external debt coverage, import concentration, state continuity, reserves, sovereign fiscal buffers |

Those domains do not all mean the same thing. Some are slow-moving structural capacity. Some are live shock exposure. Some are recovery capacity. That is why the current schema also emits three pillars.

## Why the pillar formula matters

The active CRI shape uses three pillars:

- structural readiness
- live shock exposure
- recovery capacity

The pillar-combined score uses a weighted mean with a penalty for the weakest pillar. That prevents a country from looking highly resilient only because it is strong in one area while critically weak in another.

For example, a country with strong macro indicators but fragile power infrastructure should not get the same top-line score as a country with balanced capacity across fiscal, infrastructure, health, and recovery systems. The weakest-pillar penalty makes the score more conservative when resilience is uneven.

In the API, the current default response shape is schema version 2.0, with a real `pillars[]` array. The public runtime manifest reports the active formula tag and safe construct-version metadata, so analysts can tell which methodology is live without needing internal deployment flags.

## What updates every six hours

CRI is not a once-a-year PDF rating. The live score is refreshed every six hours from official and authoritative sources where available. Some underlying indicators are annual, such as World Bank or IMF series. Others are much closer to operational time, such as conflict, cyber, shipping, outage, disease, displacement, or energy stress.

That mix is intentional. Structural resilience should not swing wildly every hour, but it should move when live stress changes the country's actual ability to absorb a shock.

A good way to read the score:

- The level tells you baseline resilience.
- The domain breakdown tells you the weak system.
- The coverage and imputation context tells you how much evidence sits behind the score.
- The runtime manifest tells you which methodology is currently active.

If you only look at the headline rank, you miss the point. The useful signal is the decomposition.

## How analysts use CRI

The most practical CRI workflow starts with a watchlist.

For a country analyst, CRI answers:

- Which countries look stable but have poor recovery capacity?
- Which countries are under stress but structurally capable?
- Which domains explain the difference between two similar-risk countries?
- Where is the model relying on imputed or thin-coverage data?

For a supply-chain team, CRI can sit beside route and supplier exposure. A port delay in a high-resilience country is different from the same delay in a country with weak state continuity, fiscal space, or logistics redundancy.

For a humanitarian or policy team, CRI helps separate "acute event severity" from "system capacity." A flood, outbreak, or border shock has different consequences depending on public-service continuity and recovery capacity.

For macro teams, CRI is a country-quality filter. It is not a trade signal by itself, but it can help explain why the same external shock transmits differently across currencies, sovereign spreads, commodity importers, and frontier markets.

For acute risk context, pair CRI with the [Country Instability Index methodology](/blog/posts/country-instability-index-methodology-explained/) and the [country risk monitoring workflow](/blog/posts/country-risk-monitoring-workflow-for-analysts/).

## Source transparency

The methodology pulls from official and authoritative providers such as World Bank, IMF, WHO, WTO, UNHCR, UCDP, BIS, IEA, FAO, Reporters Without Borders, and the Institute for Economics and Peace, among others.

WorldMonitor treats missing data as a first-class modeling issue. Coverage, imputation class, retired dimensions, and source failures are distinct states. A missing upstream feed should not quietly become a zero score, and a structurally absent data point should not be rendered as if a source failed.

That is the difference between a display metric and an auditable index. A display metric only says "Country A is 74." An auditable index lets you ask why, how much evidence was observed, what changed, and whether the methodology itself changed.

The underlying public series can be checked at the [World Bank Data portal](https://data.worldbank.org/), [IMF Data](https://www.imf.org/en/Data), [WHO Global Health Observatory](https://www.who.int/data/gho), and [UNHCR Refugee Data Finder](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/). WorldMonitor's score is a synthesis of those and other named sources, not a substitute for the original series.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is CRI the same as the Country Instability Index?**

No. CII is a faster stress and instability signal. CRI is a resilience-capacity score. A country can have high current stress and still have strong capacity to absorb it, or low current stress and weak capacity if a shock arrives.

**Does the score just reward wealthy countries?**

The methodology is designed to avoid pure wealth proxies. Indicators need to measure a direct resilience mechanism, and several constructs have been repaired specifically to avoid rewarding affluence without shock-capacity relevance.

**How should I interpret a low score?**

Start with the domain and pillar breakdown. A low top-line score could come from recovery weakness, energy vulnerability, governance stress, infrastructure exposure, health capacity, or several of those at once.

**Use CRI as a second question after risk: not just "where is stress rising?" but "which countries can actually absorb the hit?"**
