Every risk platform sells a number. A country is "72/100" or "high risk" or "amber." Almost none of them will tell you how the number is computed, which means you cannot challenge it, calibrate it, or defend it when a decision built on it goes wrong.

World Monitor's Country Instability Index (CII) takes the opposite bet: the methodology is public, the data sources are public, and this post walks through the whole machine. Not because transparency is a marketing virtue, but because **a score you cannot decompose is a score you cannot use** for anything that matters.

## What the CII Measures

The CII is a 0–100 score answering one question: **how much stress is this country under right now?** It is recomputed continuously for 31 Tier-1 countries, the states whose instability moves markets, borders, and supply chains across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific.

Scores map to five bands:

| Band | Range | Reading |
|------|-------|---------|
| Low | 0–30 | Quiet by the country's own standards |
| Normal | 31–50 | Background noise |
| Elevated | 51–65 | Watch; pressure building |
| High | 66–80 | Active stress on multiple fronts |
| Critical | 81–100 | Crisis conditions |

Each score carries a signed 24-hour delta. Movement beyond ±1 point flags the country as rising or falling, and for most analytical purposes, [the delta is more useful than the level](/blog/posts/country-risk-monitoring-workflow-for-analysts/).

## The Core Formula

The current model (v8) blends two components:

```
score = baseline_risk × 0.40 + event_score × 0.60  (+ supplemental boosts, clamped 0–100)
```

**Baseline risk (40%)** encodes a country's structural posture: the slow-moving reality that Yemen and Norway do not start from the same place. It anchors the score so that one quiet news day cannot make a war zone look like Switzerland.

**Event score (60%)** is live pressure, fused from four signal families:

| Family | Weight | What feeds it |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Conflict | 30% | ACLED battles and explosions, civilian-targeting violence, fatalities, regional strike intensity, missile-alert feeds |
| Unrest | 25% | ACLED protests and riots, protest fatalities, high-severity unrest, internet and power outages |
| Information | 25% | Alert-classified news headlines, country-attributed threat summaries |
| Security | 20% | Military flight activity, naval vessels, airspace closures and delays, GPS/GNSS jamming |

The weights encode an editorial judgment worth stating plainly: organized violence (conflict, 30%) is the strongest instability signal; mass mobilization (unrest, 25%) and the information field (25%) come next; military posturing (security, 20%) matters but is the noisiest of the four.

## Boosts: The Signals That Don't Fit a Family

Some events raise instability without being conflict or unrest. The model handles them as bounded supplemental boosts, each capped so no single feed can hijack the score:

- Earthquakes: up to +25
- Mass displacement: up to +20 (log-scaled, because the difference between 10,000 and 100,000 displaced matters more than between 900,000 and 990,000)
- Travel advisories: up to +15
- Climate anomalies: up to +15
- Sanctions pressure: up to +14
- Cyber threats: up to +12, severity-weighted
- Maritime (AIS) disruptions: up to +10
- Wildfires: up to +8

The caps are the point. An uncapped earthquake term would make Japan look like a failed state every time a fault slips; capped at +25, a major quake pushes a stable country into "elevated," which is exactly right for the disruption it causes, without claiming the government fell.

## Floors: When the Score Is Not Allowed to Look Good

Live signals can go quiet while a country remains objectively in crisis. Reporting fatigue is real, and feeds have gaps. The model enforces minimum scores tied to slow-moving authoritative data:

- **UCDP active war** (over 1,000 battle deaths or 100+ events in a two-year window): score floor of **70**
- **UCDP minor conflict** (10+ events in two years): floor of **50**
- **"Do not travel" advisory**: floor of **60**
- **"Reconsider travel" advisory**: floor of **50**

Floors are the model's defense against its own optimism. A country in an active war does not get to score 40 because this week's headlines were thin.

## What the CII Deliberately Does Not Do

The three common index types answer different questions:

| Index | Main question | Coverage and cadence |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|
| Country Instability Index (CII) | How much current stress is the country under? | 31 Tier-1 countries, updated continuously |
| Country Resilience Index (CRI) | How well can the country absorb and recover from shocks? | 196-country public universe, refreshed every six hours |
| Fragile States Index (FSI) | Which states show long-term structural fragility? | Broad global coverage, published annually |

**It does not measure structural fragility.** That is the job of the Country Resilience Index, a separate 196-country model of structural capacity across 72 indicators, 21 active dimensions, and 6 domains, refreshed every six hours. CII is the fast clock (what is burning now); resilience is the slow clock (what breaks under fire). Reading them together is the [core of a sound country-risk workflow](/blog/posts/country-risk-monitoring-workflow-for-analysts/).

**It does not predict.** The CII describes current pressure. For forward-looking signals, World Monitor pairs it with [prediction markets and AI forecasting](/blog/posts/prediction-markets-ai-forecasting-geopolitics/), different tools for a different question.

**It does not cover every country at full depth.** Tier-1 fusion, the full pipeline above, runs on 31 countries. Pretending sensor-grade coverage exists everywhere would be exactly the kind of opacity this index is built against.

## Why Transparent Beats Proprietary

A worked example. Suppose Country X reads 68 (High), up 6 in 24 hours. With a black-box score, that is where the analysis ends. With the CII, you decompose it: the jump came from the unrest family (new ACLED riot events with fatalities) plus an internet-outage boost, not from conflict or military signals. That tells you what kind of crisis this is (civil, not military), which sources to read next, and what would confirm escalation (security signals joining in).

The decomposition is the analysis. The number is just the index into it.

## Using the CII

- **Dashboard:** the CII panel at [worldmonitor.app](https://www.worldmonitor.app) shows all 31 countries with scores, bands, and 24-hour deltas; any country's brief decomposes its score.
- **API:** `get-country-risk` returns the score and component breakdown as JSON for [your own models](/blog/posts/build-on-worldmonitor-developer-api-open-source/).
- **AI agents:** the `get_country_risk` tool on the [MCP server](/blog/posts/worldmonitor-mcp-server-ai-agents-real-time-intelligence/) gives Claude and other assistants the same data, so "why did Egypt's risk score move?" becomes a question your agent can actually answer.

## Conflict Data References

The index should be read alongside primary conflict datasets such as the [Uppsala Conflict Data Program](https://ucdp.uu.se/) and [ACLED](https://acleddata.com/). It is an analytical signal, not a substitute for the source event records or local verification.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How often is the Country Instability Index updated?**

Scores are precomputed server-side on a continuous loop (roughly every eight minutes) from live feeds, with 24-hour deltas tracked against daily snapshots.

**Which countries does the CII cover?**

31 Tier-1 countries, including the US, China, Russia, Ukraine, Iran, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, India, Pakistan, Taiwan, North and South Korea, Japan, Germany, France, the UK, Poland, Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela, plus the major Middle East states.

**How is this different from indices like the Fragile States Index?**

Annual indices measure structural conditions with a 12-month cadence; the CII measures live event pressure with a minutes-level cadence and anchors it to structural baselines and UCDP/advisory floors. They are complements: one tells you which states are fragile, the other tells you which are under stress this week.
