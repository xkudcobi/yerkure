Energy is the transmission belt between geopolitics and everything else. A strait closes, a pipeline drops pressure, a cold snap lands on thin storage — and within weeks the same event has become a freight story, an inflation story, and a political story. That's why energy analysis can't live inside a single market feed: the causes are physical and geopolitical, and only the consequences are financial.

WorldMonitor's [energy-shock monitoring workflow](/blog/posts/energy-shock-monitoring-chokepoints-worldmonitor/) taught readers to assemble that picture by hand across the main dashboard. Now there's a purpose-built instrument: **energy.worldmonitor.app**, a dedicated energy dashboard with panels arranged around one question — *is energy flowing, and at what price?*

## The physical layer: flows, chokepoints, infrastructure

The dashboard opens on the **Energy Atlas map** and a **Chokepoint Status strip** covering the [canonical monitored-waterway registry](/blog/posts/what-is-a-maritime-chokepoint/). Waterways with EIA baselines publish live oil-and-gas flow estimates. The **Strait of Hormuz Tracker** gets its own panel, because roughly a fifth of global oil transit deserves one.

Around the chokepoints sits the fixed infrastructure:

- **Oil & Gas Pipeline Status** — the mapped pipeline registry with status tracking.
- **Strategic Storage Atlas** — where the buffers physically are.
- **Global Fuel Shortage Registry** — where the buffers have already failed.
- **Energy Disruptions Log** — the running record of outages, attacks, and force majeure events.

This is the layer most market tools skip entirely: they show you the price of the disruption, not the disruption.

## The market and policy layers

The market panels reuse WorldMonitor's finance engine, curated for energy: the **Oil & Gas Complex**, **EIA inventories**, **WTI, Brent, and natural-gas quotes**, and the **Market Regime** signal. The policy layer is what makes it an energy-*security* dashboard rather than a commodity screen: the **Energy Crisis Policy Tracker** follows government interventions — price caps, subsidies, export bans — while [**Sanctions Pressure**](/blog/posts/monitor-global-sanctions-pressure-worldmonitor/), **Gulf & OPEC Economies**, and **GCC Energy Investments** track the actors who move supply on purpose.

The demand side closes the loop: **Retail Fuel Prices** (the number citizens actually feel — the same [ground-truth philosophy](/blog/posts/ground-truth-inflation-shelf-price-tracking-worldmonitor/) as the shelf-price tracker), **Climate & Weather Impact** as the demand driver, and **Renewable Energy** for the structural shift underneath it all.

## The data backbone

The panels sit on named, official sources rather than a scraped mash: **EIA** petroleum stocks and flow baselines, **JODI** oil and gas data, **Ember** electricity data, **GIE AGSI+** for European gas storage levels, **Our World in Data** energy-mix series, and **IMF PortWatch with live AIS** for chokepoint transits. Where a source lags or a series is missing, the dashboard shows the gap — the same no-silent-zeros discipline as the chokepoint model.

## How to read it: the escalation chain

Energy shocks propagate in a fixed order, and the dashboard is arranged to match: chokepoint status turns yellow → tanker traffic reroutes → the disruptions log confirms the physical event → storage starts drawing → crisis policies appear → retail prices move. Each hop has a panel. When you can watch the whole chain on one screen, you stop discovering shocks at the retail-price stage — which is where most people, and most portfolios, currently discover them.

For pre-event work, the [Scenario Engine's](/blog/posts/stress-test-supply-chain-scenario-engine-worldmonitor/) Hormuz and Suez stress tests pair naturally with this dashboard; for the market translation, the [geopolitics-to-markets pipeline](/blog/posts/geopolitics-to-markets-pipeline-macro-traders-worldmonitor/) picks up where the chain ends.

## For developers and agents

The `get_energy_intelligence` MCP tool returns the core bundle — petroleum stocks, electricity prices, gas storage, fuel shortages, disruptions, and crisis policies — in one call, with `get_chokepoint_status` covering live transits and `get_commodity_geo` the production geography. There's even a pre-built **energy-shock-watch** prompt template on the MCP server that wires the right tools and projections together for you. The [risk-agent tutorial](/blog/posts/build-geopolitical-risk-agent-worldmonitor-mcp/) shows the general pattern.

## Limits

Live flow estimates cover the chokepoints with EIA baselines. Gas-storage depth is strongest for Europe, where GIE's AGSI+ transparency regime exists; most of the world publishes nothing comparable. Electricity data inherits Ember's reporting cadence, and retail fuel-price coverage varies by country. The dashboard's job is to show you what's knowable and label what isn't — not to interpolate confidence where the world doesn't publish data.

## Primary Energy Sources

Interpret live indicators against authoritative references such as the EIA's [World Oil Transit Chokepoints](https://www.eia.gov/international/content/analysis/special_topics/World_Oil_Transit_Chokepoints/) analysis and Gas Infrastructure Europe's [AGSI storage data](https://agsi.gie.eu/). Each source has its own reporting cadence and revision policy.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is the energy dashboard free?**

Yes — like every WorldMonitor variant, energy.worldmonitor.app is free with no login. The Latest Brief panel is the one Pro-locked element at launch.

**How is this different from the main WorldMonitor dashboard?**

Same engine, different curation: the energy variant strips the general geopolitical panels and assembles every energy-relevant panel — chokepoints, pipelines, storage, shortages, policies, prices — into one purpose-built layout with its own Energy Atlas map.

**Can AI agents query the energy data?**

Yes — `get_energy_intelligence`, `get_chokepoint_status`, and `get_commodity_geo` via the MCP server, plus the pre-built energy-shock-watch prompt template. REST equivalents are in the [API reference](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/api-reference).
