Country risk due diligence is the process of asking: "What could go wrong because this deal, supplier, shipment, facility, or trip depends on a country?"

Most teams answer that question with a static country report. That is useful once. It is not enough when conflict events, sanctions exposure, travel advisories, cyber activity, market stress, and public-health signals can change every day.

WorldMonitor gives risk teams a more repeatable workflow: combine the Country Instability Index, advisory provenance, sanctions pressure, conflict events, macro indicators, and news intelligence into a living country-risk file. If you are starting from the scoring model itself, read the [Country Instability Index methodology](/blog/posts/country-instability-index-methodology-explained/) first; if you need the same workflow in software, pair this guide with the [developer API overview](/blog/posts/build-on-worldmonitor-developer-api-open-source/).

## When to run a country risk workflow

Use this workflow before:

- Entering a new market
- Approving a distributor or supplier
- Sending staff to a higher-risk country
- Opening a bank, logistics, or infrastructure relationship
- Reviewing sanctions or political exposure
- Deciding whether a developing situation affects an existing operation

The output should not be a 40-page report. It should be a short decision memo with evidence, unknowns, and next checks.

## The core country-risk packet

For each country, collect the same fields every time:

| Category | What to collect | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Instability | CII score, band, component breakdown | Gives a comparable 0-100 risk frame |
| Advisory state | Level and provenance | Separates live government input from fallback or absent data |
| Conflict and unrest | Recent armed conflict, protest, riot, strike, and unrest events | Shows whether risk is active or mostly structural |
| Sanctions | Pressure score and listed entity exposure | Flags compliance and counterparty risk |
| Macro | Inflation, GDP, unemployment, current account, debt, or savings-investment stress | Identifies economic fragility |
| News intelligence | Cross-source signals and narrative clusters | Shows what is being reported now |
| Market context | FX, commodities, or equity moves where relevant | Connects country risk to financial exposure |

This packet creates consistency. A country can be compared against itself over time and against peer countries in the same region.

## Use CII as a starting point, not the whole answer

The [Country Instability Index methodology](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/methodology/cii-risk-scores) gives each country a 0-100 instability score with component-level context. Use it as a triage layer:

| CII band | Practical meaning |
|---|---|
| Low | Routine monitoring is usually enough |
| Watch | Review exposure and watch for movement |
| Elevated | Require a written risk note before approval |
| High | Escalate to risk, legal, security, or leadership |
| Critical | Pause or require executive exception |

The score is useful because it is comparable. The component breakdown is useful because it tells you why the score moved.

## Preserve advisory provenance

A country risk workflow should never hide where advisory input came from. WorldMonitor's CII score exposes advisory provenance so downstream users can distinguish:

| Provenance | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `live` | A current advisory feed contributed to the score |
| `fallback` | A curated fallback table was used when live data was unavailable |
| `absent` | No advisory input contributed |

Those states are materially different. `absent` does not mean safe. It means the advisory signal is missing.

## Due diligence workflow

### 1. Build the country watchlist

Create a watchlist with ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes:

```json
{
  "countries": ["TR", "EG", "AE", "SA", "IN", "CN", "TW", "MX", "DE", "US"]
}
```

Group countries by exposure type:

- Supplier country
- Customer country
- Transit country
- Investment country
- Staff travel country
- Sanctions-sensitive country

### 2. Pull country risk

For the Turkish logistics example below, start with the [Turkey country profile](https://www.worldmonitor.app/countries/turkey/) and check its observation dates. With MCP, use:

```json
{
  "name": "get_country_risk",
  "arguments": {
    "country_code": "TR",
    "jmespath": "{score: score, level: level, components: components, advisoryLevel: advisoryLevel, advisoryProvenance: advisoryProvenance, sanctions: sanctions, cached_at: cached_at, stale: stale}"
  }
}
```

With REST, use the intelligence service from the [API reference](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/api-reference). For production systems, generate a typed client from the bundled OpenAPI spec and keep the response fields explicit.

### 3. Add live context

Country risk becomes more useful when paired with current signals:

- `get_conflict_events` for active conflict and unrest
- `get_news_intelligence` for cross-source signals
- `get_sanctions_data` for compliance exposure
- `get_country_macro` for economic context
- `get_cyber_threats` if the exposure includes digital infrastructure

### 4. Write a one-page memo

Use a consistent memo structure:

```text
Country: Turkey
Decision: approve supplier onboarding / hold / escalate
Exposure: logistics provider, Eastern Mediterranean route
Current state: elevated
Freshness: country risk fresh; news digest stale=false

Key signals:
- CII band and component drivers
- Advisory provenance
- Conflict or unrest events
- Sanctions exposure
- Macro stress indicators

Risk interpretation:
- What could affect the decision?
- What is unknown?
- What would change the recommendation?

Next checks:
- Re-run in 24 hours
- Alert if band changes
- Review if sanctions pressure changes
```

The memo is short because the data packet carries the detail.

## Make it continuous

Due diligence is not only a pre-approval step. For countries with live exposure, run a daily or weekly monitor:

| Cadence | Use case |
|---|---|
| Daily | Staff safety, logistics routes, active crisis exposure |
| Weekly | Supplier, market-entry, and investment monitoring |
| Monthly | Board-level country risk register |
| Event-driven | CII band change, sanctions update, advisory change, conflict spike |

For every update, compare against the previous packet. "What changed?" is more actionable than "what is the score?"

## Avoid false precision

Country risk is probabilistic and incomplete. Good due diligence writing should say:

- "No live advisory input is present" instead of "advisory risk is low."
- "The score is elevated because unrest and security components are high" instead of "the country is risky."
- "Forecast confidence is separate from event probability" instead of turning a model's confidence into a probability of escalation.
- "Data is stale" instead of silently treating old data as current.

This is the difference between an intelligence workflow and a polished guess.

## Due-Diligence Sources

Corroborate country findings with first-party sources such as [World Bank Data](https://data.worldbank.org/) and the [US Treasury sanctions programs and country information](https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information). Dashboard signals accelerate triage; they do not replace legal, financial, or local-source review.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is country risk monitoring?**
Country risk monitoring is the repeated review of political, security, sanctions, macroeconomic, health, infrastructure, and market signals that could affect an organization's exposure to a country.

**What is the Country Instability Index?**
The Country Instability Index is WorldMonitor's 0-100 country-level risk score. It combines structural and live signals such as conflict, unrest, security events, information velocity, advisory input, and other risk indicators.

**Can WorldMonitor replace a human country analyst?**
No. WorldMonitor is a data and workflow layer. It helps analysts collect consistent evidence, catch changes faster, and write clearer memos. Human judgment is still needed for decisions.

**What should a due diligence memo include?**
Include the decision, exposure type, CII state, component drivers, advisory provenance, sanctions exposure, recent conflict or news signals, unknowns, and next checks.
