Governments announce their priorities through procurement before they announce them through policy. A defense ministry tendering for drone-detection systems, a health agency buying cold-chain logistics, a municipality procuring flood barriers — each notice is a documented, budgeted statement of intent, published weeks or months before the contract shows up in any news cycle.

The problem is that this signal is scattered across national portals that share no format, no API conventions, and no common vocabulary. WorldMonitor's Global Procurement panel pulls the major official sources into one searchable feed.

## Six official sources, one feed

The procurement pipeline reads only official public interfaces — no scraping of portal HTML:

| Source | Coverage |
|---|---|
| SAM.gov | United States federal opportunities |
| TED | European Union public procurement notices |
| Contracts Finder | United Kingdom (OCDS tender releases) |
| CanadaBuys | Canada federal open tenders |
| GETS | New Zealand / Oceania |
| World Bank Procurement Notices | Multilateral, across borrower countries |

A seeder refreshes the canonical snapshot hourly. If one source fails, the others keep flowing and the response reports `availability: "partial"` with that source's last-good records retained — a failed adapter is never displayed as "zero tenders."

One deliberate gap: Australia. AusTender publishes no machine-readable feed that includes closing dates, and WorldMonitor never represents an opportunity without a verifiable deadline. Australian coverage stays absent rather than inferred — the reasoning is documented in the [Global Procurement Intelligence docs](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/global-procurement-intelligence).

## What's in the feed right now

Talk is cheap; here is one live query — `query: "software", sort: closing_soon` — run against the feed on July 22, 2026:

| Opportunity | Buyer | Source | Closes |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Software and IT System Support](https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/procurement-detail/OP00455744) | World Bank project | World Bank | Jul 23 |
| [Collaborative Autonomy Software Framework Development](https://sam.gov/workspace/contract/opp/fc8c15f3161248be842ae9c07527d15a/view) | US Air Force — AFLCMC, ISR directorate | SAM.gov | Aug 1 |
| [Culture and Employee Experience Evolution Support RFP](https://www.merx.com/public/solicitations/4019038063/abstract?language=EN) | Farm Credit Canada | CanadaBuys | Aug 4 |
| [Portable Ultrasound Simulator](https://www.gets.govt.nz//UA/ExternalTenderDetails.htm?id=34516070) | University of Auckland | GETS (NZ) | Aug 14 |

Official sources across multiple jurisdictions, one query, and notice links intact. An Air Force autonomy-software solicitation sitting next to a World Bank IT tender and a New Zealand university's simulator purchase is exactly what a cross-portal feed is for — no single national portal shows you that row set.

## If you already live in SAM.gov

Then you don't need this feed for the US — SAM.gov's saved searches and NAICS/PSC alerts are precise, free, and native, and GovWin adds the enterprise-grade capture layer if you can pay for it. The honest pitch is different: **the cross-portal problem.** The moment your pipeline crosses a border, you're juggling TED's schema, Contracts Finder's OCDS releases, CanadaBuys CSVs, and GETS RSS — separately, in different vocabularies, with different alert mechanics. This feed's job is one schema and one query across all six official sources, with US coverage as a member of the set rather than the whole set. If your business is US-only, keep your SAM alerts; if it isn't, this is the aggregation you'd otherwise build yourself.

## Opportunities, not just awards

WorldMonitor separates two different questions:

- **What has been awarded?** Historical US award data from USASpending remains in the free Economic panel. Awards tell you who won and what a government spent.
- **What is open right now?** The Global Procurement panel is forward-looking: open tenders you can still act on, with deadlines, buyers, estimated values, and official notice links.

Within the panel you can search titles and descriptions, filter by buyer, country, and source, and sort by newest, closing soon, estimated value, or relevance. Every record keeps its official notice URL and source ID, so the panel is a discovery layer, never a substitute for the official portal where you actually bid.

## The technology-relevance filter

For software, AI, data, cybersecurity, and cloud vendors, most of a raw tender feed is noise — road resurfacing, catering contracts, office furniture. Each record carries an `automationFit` score: a transparent, keyword-based relevance signal with match reasons and text evidence. The panel exposes it as a **Technology relevant only** checkbox; the API exposes it as `min_automation_score`.

It is deliberately labeled a relevance signal, not an eligibility determination. Whether your company can legally bid on a French defense tender is a question for the official notice, and `participationMode` stays `unknown` unless the source states it.

## For developers and agents

The same feed is available programmatically:

- **REST:** `GET /api/economic/v1/list-global-tenders` — paginated up to 100 records per page, with filters for country, region, source, status, buyer, publish and deadline dates, value range, currency, category, and free-text query. See the [API reference](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/api-reference).
- **MCP:** the `get_procurement_opportunities` tool gives AI agents a compact projection (10 records by default, 25 max) so an agent can ask "open cybersecurity tenders in the EU closing in the next 30 days" without flooding its context window.

Both paths are part of WorldMonitor Pro and enforce the subscription server-side. Pair the feed with [country risk screening](/blog/posts/country-risk-monitoring-due-diligence-worldmonitor/) before chasing an opportunity in an unfamiliar market, and with the [tariff and trade-policy trackers](/blog/posts/tariff-tracker-trade-policy-monitoring-worldmonitor/) when the contract involves cross-border delivery.

## Procurement as an intelligence signal

Even if you never bid on anything, tender flow is worth watching. Clusters of notices reveal budget priorities: a spike in border-surveillance procurement, a wave of grid-hardening contracts, a sudden multilateral push for emergency food logistics. Because notices carry official buyers, values, and deadlines, they are among the least ambiguous signals in open-source intelligence — nobody publishes a tender by accident.

## Limits

Coverage currently includes official sources for the US, EU, UK, Canada, New Zealand, and World Bank-financed projects, and remains absent elsewhere until more official machine-readable sources ship. Estimated values are only present when the source publishes them. The `automationFit` score is keyword-based by design: transparent and auditable, but not a semantic model, so skim beyond your filter occasionally.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is the tender feed free?**

No. Global Procurement is a Pro feature, enforced server-side on both the panel and the API. Historical US award data in the Economic panel remains free.

**How fresh is the data?**

The seeder runs hourly and the snapshot carries a three-hour retention window, so a single missed run serves the prior successful snapshot rather than an empty feed. Every response includes its snapshot time and per-source health.

**Can I get alerts for new tenders matching my keywords?**

Use the API with a saved query and your own scheduler, or point an MCP-connected agent at `get_procurement_opportunities` on a schedule — the [Slack and Teams alerting guide](/blog/posts/geopolitical-risk-alerts-slack-teams-worldmonitor-api/) shows the pattern.
