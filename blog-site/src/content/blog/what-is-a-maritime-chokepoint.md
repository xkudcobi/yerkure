A maritime chokepoint is a narrow passage where a large share of global trade, energy, food, or military movement must pass through a small physical space.

Chokepoints matter because rerouting is expensive, slow, or sometimes impossible. When a canal, strait, or sea lane is disrupted, the effects can move from vessel schedules to freight rates, commodity prices, insurance costs, factory inventories, and national security planning.

The familiar examples are the Strait of Hormuz, Suez Canal, Panama Canal, Bab el-Mandeb, Strait of Malacca, Bosporus, and Taiwan Strait. But the operational question is not just "is this place famous?" It is:

> Is the passage strategically concentrated, exposed to disruption, and connected to a trade or energy flow that matters?

That is the question WorldMonitor's chokepoint model tries to make visible.

## Why chokepoints matter

Chokepoints turn geography into market and security risk.

If a ship can choose between several similar routes, a disruption may be annoying but manageable. If many routes collapse into one narrow passage, the same disruption can become systemic.

Chokepoints matter for five reasons:

- Volume concentration: many vessels or high-value cargoes pass through the same corridor.
- Energy exposure: oil, LNG, refined products, or petrochemicals depend on the route.
- Military pressure: naval conflict, mines, seizures, or escort zones change behavior.
- Insurance and freight cost: even partial risk can raise costs before a route closes.
- Substitution limits: alternate routes may add days, fuel, port congestion, or political constraints.

A chokepoint does not need to close completely to matter. A credible threat, navigation warning, or traffic anomaly can be enough to change routing and pricing.

## The monitored-waterway registry

WorldMonitor's canonical chokepoint registry includes:

| Canonical id | Public name |
|---|---|
| `hormuz_strait` | [Strait of Hormuz](https://www.worldmonitor.app/chokepoints/strait-of-hormuz/) |
| `malacca_strait` | [Strait of Malacca](https://www.worldmonitor.app/chokepoints/strait-of-malacca/) |
| `suez` | [Suez Canal / SUMED](https://www.worldmonitor.app/chokepoints/suez-canal/) |
| `bab_el_mandeb` | [Bab el-Mandeb](https://www.worldmonitor.app/chokepoints/bab-el-mandeb/) |
| `panama` | [Panama Canal](https://www.worldmonitor.app/chokepoints/panama-canal/) |
| `taiwan_strait` | [Taiwan Strait](https://www.worldmonitor.app/chokepoints/taiwan-strait/) |
| `cape_of_good_hope` | [Cape of Good Hope](https://www.worldmonitor.app/chokepoints/cape-of-good-hope/) |
| `gibraltar` | [Strait of Gibraltar](https://www.worldmonitor.app/chokepoints/strait-of-gibraltar/) |
| `bosphorus` | [Bosporus Strait](https://www.worldmonitor.app/chokepoints/bosporus-strait/) |
| `korea_strait` | [Korea Strait](https://www.worldmonitor.app/chokepoints/korea-strait/) |
| `dover_strait` | [Dover Strait](https://www.worldmonitor.app/chokepoints/dover-strait/) |
| `kerch_strait` | [Kerch Strait](https://www.worldmonitor.app/chokepoints/kerch-strait/) |
| `lombok_strait` | [Lombok Strait](https://www.worldmonitor.app/chokepoints/lombok-strait/) |

All 13 can receive status, threat classification, warning context, AIS-disruption matching, disruption score, and war-risk tier.

Only seven of those 13 currently publish live oil/gas flow estimates backed by EIA baseline IDs: Hormuz, Malacca, Suez, Bab el-Mandeb, Dover, Bosporus, and Panama. The other six can still be strategically important, but they do not yet carry the same baseline-backed `flowEstimate` field.

That distinction prevents a common analytics mistake: showing a missing flow estimate as if it were zero traffic. Missing modeled flow is not the same thing as no flow.

## How WorldMonitor scores chokepoint status

The public status badge is a traffic-light score: green, yellow, or red. It is not a literal closure label.

The disruption score combines:

- a baseline geopolitical threat weight
- active NGA navigational warnings
- AIS congestion severity
- a transit anomaly bonus when PortWatch daily transits drop sharply under high-threat conditions

Nothing else moves the number. AIS event counts, relay transit counts, and PortWatch week-over-week movement are published as context rather than score inputs. PortWatch supplies both: the anomaly bonus compares its daily transit history, seven days against the prior thirty, while the week-over-week figure on the page is presentation only.

The score is capped at 100. Green is below 20, yellow is 20 to 49, and red is 50 or higher.

That design matters because chokepoint risk has multiple modes. A normal route with one warning is not the same as a war-zone route with falling traffic and high AIS disruption. The badge is a compact way to expose combined pressure, not a claim that a waterway is physically closed.

## How live flow estimates work

For the seven energy-baseline-backed waterways, WorldMonitor computes live flow by comparing recent PortWatch observations with a prior rolling baseline. The model uses tanker deadweight tonnage when coverage is good enough; otherwise it can use tanker counts. It publishes current million-barrels-per-day estimates by multiplying the observed flow ratio by the annual EIA baseline.

The ratio can range up to 150 percent of baseline after clamping. A separate `disrupted` boolean is true only when the latest three individual days are all below 85 percent of the same baseline window.

This is a conservative approach. It avoids calling a thin or missing series "zero," and it separates a color badge from the energy-flow model.

## How to read a chokepoint alert

When a chokepoint turns yellow or red, ask four questions:

1. Is the problem physical, military, weather-related, regulatory, or data-coverage related?
2. Is traffic actually changing, or is the threat score rising before traffic moves?
3. Which commodities, countries, or sectors depend on the route?
4. What alternate route exists, and how costly is the detour?

For operational decisions, the fourth question is often the most important. A disruption with a cheap alternate route is different from one that forces ships around a continent or cuts off a specialized cargo flow.

## Source transparency

WorldMonitor's chokepoint status combines Redis-backed transit summaries, flow estimates, navigational warnings, AIS disruption matching, and a static threat taxonomy. Upstream gaps are surfaced as unavailable data rather than silently turned into calm conditions.

The model has known limits. AIS coverage can degrade near conflict zones or regions with jamming. Only the seven energy-baseline waterways have live oil/gas flow estimates today. Baseline values are used to convert observed ratios into flow estimates; they are not a promise that live observations perfectly capture every vessel.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is a red chokepoint always closed?**

No. Red means the combined disruption score is high. It can reflect military threat, active warnings, AIS disruption, anomaly signals, or several of those at once.

**Why do only some waterways have live flow estimates?**

Because those seven have EIA baseline IDs in the current energy-flow seeder. The other canonical waterways can still have status and risk context without publishing an oil/gas flow estimate.

**What is the most important chokepoint?**

It depends on the decision. Hormuz is central for Gulf energy, Malacca for Asia-Europe trade, Suez and Bab el-Mandeb for the Red Sea corridor, Panama for canal capacity, and Taiwan for East Asian strategic risk.

**A chokepoint is where geography removes optionality. The risk is not just traffic today, but how little room the system has when that traffic changes.**
