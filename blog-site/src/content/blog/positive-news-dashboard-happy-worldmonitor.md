The news industry has a structural bias, not a conspiracy: bad news is sudden and good news is gradual. A pipeline explosion is an event; a species recovering is a decade. Feeds optimized for events will always overweight catastrophe — which is how you end up with an audience that knows every disaster and none of the progress.

WorldMonitor's answer isn't a filter that hides the bad news. It's a dedicated dashboard with the polarity reversed: **happy.worldmonitor.app**, the same intelligence engine pointed at what's improving.

## Same engine, inverted filter

The Happy variant is not a greeting-card site. It runs the same infrastructure as the geopolitical dashboard — feed ingestion, deduplication, classification, mapping — over a curated positive-news catalog: dedicated positive outlets (Good News Network, Positive.News, Reasons to be Cheerful, Optimist Daily, and others), science sources (Nature News, ScienceDaily, New Scientist, Human Progress), conservation reporting (Mongabay, Conservation Optimism), health, community, and everyday-hero stories.

The panels are built around measurable progress, not just pleasant headlines:

- **Good News Feed** — the classified, deduplicated positive stream.
- **Human Progress** — the long arc: development, health, and quality-of-life gains.
- **Live Counters** — running counts of things going right.
- **5 Good Things** — a daily digest for people who want a ritual, not a feed.
- **Today's Hero** — one person who did something worth knowing about.
- **Breakthroughs** — science and medicine that actually advanced.
- **Conservation Wins** — species recoveries and protected-area gains.
- **Renewable Energy** — the clean-energy buildout as it happens.
- **Global Giving** — philanthropy and aid flows.

The map inverts too: layers for positive events, acts of kindness, world happiness, species recovery, and clean-energy installations replace conflict zones and threat markers.

## Why a serious platform ships a good-news dashboard

Two reasons. The honest one: sustained doom consumption degrades judgment. Analysts who marinate in threat feeds develop a risk perception that's miscalibrated high — everything reads as escalation. A deliberate dose of base-rate progress is calibration, not escapism. It's the same reasoning that puts [prediction markets](/blog/posts/prediction-markets-ai-forecasting-geopolitics/) next to the news: outside views correct inside spirals.

The structural one: positive events are intelligence. Peace agreements, humanitarian aid flows, and diplomatic breakthroughs are state actions with consequences, and the `get_positive_events` MCP tool exposes them — diplomatic agreements, aid commitments, peace initiatives — to the same agents that consume conflict data. A model of the world built only from negatives is simply wrong.

The Happy variant is one of the [specialized dashboards on the platform](/blog/posts/five-dashboards-one-platform-worldmonitor-variants/), and like the others it's free, no login, and switchable in one click — same account, same infrastructure, and the same runtime locale catalog.

## Limits

Curation is editorial: feeds chosen for credibility and signal, which means judgment calls about what counts as "positive." Progress data is slower-moving than event data by nature — the counters and progress panels update on the cadence of their underlying sources. And no, reading good news doesn't change the world state; it changes whether your model of the world state is complete.

## Source transparency

The curated feed catalog is public in WorldMonitor's [source configuration](https://github.com/koala73/worldmonitor/blob/main/src/config/feeds.ts). Individual cards still link to their original publisher so readers can inspect the evidence behind each progress claim.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is the Happy dashboard free?**

Yes — free and login-free like the other WorldMonitor variants. It's at happy.worldmonitor.app.

**Is this just filtered regular news?**

No. It's a separate curated feed set spanning positive-news, science, conservation, and community sources, run through the same classification and deduplication pipeline as the intelligence dashboards, with its own panels and map layers.

**Can apps and agents use the positive-events data?**

Yes. The `get_positive_events` MCP tool returns diplomatic agreements, humanitarian aid, and peace initiatives in structured form — the counterweight layer for any agent consuming conflict data.
