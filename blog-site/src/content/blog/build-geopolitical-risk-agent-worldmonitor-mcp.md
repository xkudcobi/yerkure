A geopolitical risk agent is an AI assistant that can answer live risk questions with current data instead of memory. It should know which countries are deteriorating, which chokepoints are stressed, which markets are moving, which flights or ships matter, and whether its data is fresh enough to trust.

WorldMonitor is built for that pattern. The [MCP server](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/mcp-overview) exposes the same intelligence stack that powers the dashboard through the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), so compatible clients can call live tools rather than scrape pages or paste screenshots into a chat window. If you want a no-code version first, start with [asking Claude what is happening in the world](/blog/posts/ask-claude-whats-happening-worldmonitor-mcp/); if you need deterministic backend jobs, use the [developer API overview](/blog/posts/build-on-worldmonitor-developer-api-open-source/) alongside MCP.

This guide shows one practical build: a risk agent that can brief a country, check route exposure, summarize conflict signals, and return a source-aware answer.

## What the agent should do

Start with a narrow job. A useful geopolitical risk agent does not need to "monitor the world" in the abstract. It needs to answer operational questions such as:

- "What changed in Egypt, Jordan, and Israel overnight?"
- "Is the Strait of Hormuz riskier today than last week?"
- "What live signals should I watch before approving a shipment?"
- "Summarize country risk for Turkey with conflict, sanctions, macro, and advisory context."
- "Give me a market-open brief that includes oil, gold, FX, prediction markets, and major conflicts."

The common pattern is the same every time:

1. Identify the country, route, market, or scenario.
2. Pull structured data from WorldMonitor.
3. Keep freshness and uncertainty visible.
4. Ask the model to synthesize, not invent.
5. Return a decision-ready brief with next checks.

## Why use MCP instead of a normal API call?

REST APIs are best when your application already knows which endpoint it wants. MCP is best when an AI client needs to discover tools, inspect schemas, and decide which calls to make for a user request.

WorldMonitor exposes both. The [API reference](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/api-reference) is better for codegen, dashboards, and pipelines. MCP is better for Claude Desktop, Claude web, Cursor, MCP Inspector, and custom agent runtimes that already understand tool calling.

The current WorldMonitor MCP server exposes:

| Surface | What it gives the agent |
|---|---|
| Live tools | Live or cache-backed calls across conflicts, markets, aviation, maritime, cyber, energy, forecasts, health, country risk, and China decision signals |
| 6 prompts | Pre-built workflows such as country briefing, conflict pulse, route risk check, and market-open prep |
| 4 resources | Stable read-only URIs for country risk, chokepoint status, seed freshness, and market quotes |
| OAuth and API-key auth | OAuth for supported MCP clients; `X-WorldMonitor-Key` for server-side scripts |

## Connect the MCP client

For most clients, the entire setup is one URL:

```text
https://worldmonitor.app/mcp
```

Claude Desktop, Claude web, Cursor, MCP Inspector, and similar clients can use that URL and run discovery automatically. WorldMonitor's MCP docs also include client-specific snippets for Claude Desktop and Cursor.

For a server-side script, call the JSON-RPC endpoint directly with an API key:

```bash
curl -s https://worldmonitor.app/mcp \
  -H "X-WorldMonitor-Key: $WM_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

The MCP authorization spec treats protected MCP servers as OAuth resource servers. WorldMonitor follows that direction with OAuth metadata and a direct API-key path for server-side integrations.

## Use a tool plan, not a giant prompt

Good risk agents are boring in the right places. They should follow a predictable tool plan before they write prose.

For a country briefing, use this sequence:

| Step | MCP surface | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `get_country_risk` | CII score, component breakdown, advisory provenance, sanctions exposure |
| 2 | `get_conflict_events` | Active conflict and unrest context |
| 3 | `get_country_macro` | IMF macro indicators and economic stress context |
| 4 | `get_news_intelligence` | Cross-source news signals and recent threat narratives |
| 5 | `get_forecast_predictions` | Cached forecast context, if available |

For a route-risk check, use:

| Step | MCP surface | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `get_chokepoint_status` | Transit counts, risk posture, route stress |
| 2 | `get_maritime_activity` | Vessel snapshots and AIS density by country |
| 3 | `get_energy_intelligence` | Fuel shortages, energy disruptions, policy response |
| 4 | `get_market_data` | Oil, gold, FX, equity, and commodity context |
| 5 | `get_news_intelligence` | Narrative confirmation and source diversity |

## Ask for compact payloads

WorldMonitor tools support JMESPath projection where useful. That matters because intelligence payloads can get large, and agents perform better when they receive the exact fields needed for the task.

Example: ask for only the country score, advisory state, component breakdown, and freshness fields:

```json
{
  "country_code": "TR",
  "jmespath": "{score: score, level: level, components: components, advisory: advisoryProvenance, cached_at: cached_at, stale: stale}"
}
```

The model now has enough to reason without being flooded by every supporting field.

## Production prompt template

Use a system or developer instruction like this:

```text
You are a geopolitical risk analyst. Use WorldMonitor tools before answering live risk questions. Prefer country risk, conflict events, chokepoint status, market data, and news intelligence over memory. Always report data freshness when fields include cached_at or stale. Separate observed signals from interpretation. Do not turn model confidence into event probability.
```

That last sentence matters. A model's confidence in an analysis is not the same as the probability that an event will happen. Keep them separate in the final brief.

## Example final answer shape

A strong agent answer should be short enough for an operator and structured enough for audit:

```text
Turkey risk brief

Status: elevated, not crisis.
Freshness: country risk cache fresh; market data stale=false; news digest cached_at=...

Observed signals:
- CII score is in the elevated band, driven by unrest and security components.
- Recent conflict feed is concentrated near border regions.
- Macro context shows currency and inflation sensitivity.
- No single source confirms an immediate escalation trigger.

Assessment:
The main operational risk is volatility around border security and energy transit, not a broad domestic breakdown. Monitor conflict events, FX stress, and new travel advisories before approving exposed travel or shipment decisions.

Next checks:
1. Re-run country risk in 6 hours.
2. Check chokepoints if route includes Black Sea or Eastern Mediterranean exposure.
3. Alert if CII band changes or travel advisory provenance flips to live high-risk input.
```

## Guardrails for agent builders

Do not let the agent become a headline blender. Add these rules:

- Require at least one structured data call before a live-risk answer.
- Show `cached_at` and `stale` fields when the tool returns them.
- Treat missing data as missing, not safe.
- Do not hide advisory provenance. `live`, `fallback`, and `absent` mean different things.
- Use cached tools for routine polling and live LLM tools only when synthesis is needed.
- Keep a short decision log for high-impact alerts.

## What to build next

Once the basic agent works, add one of these workflows:

| Workflow | Why it is useful |
|---|---|
| Daily country watchlist | Brief the same 5-20 countries every morning with consistent fields |
| Route risk check | Pair `get_chokepoint_status` with maritime, energy, and market tools |
| Market-open prep | Combine conflicts, oil, gold, FX, crypto, and prediction markets |
| Freshness audit | Ask the agent to inspect seed freshness before trusting a briefing |
| Incident explainer | Given a headline, fetch structured context before summarizing |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is a geopolitical risk agent?**
A geopolitical risk agent is an AI assistant that uses live data tools to monitor country risk, conflicts, markets, transport, cyber, and infrastructure signals, then turns those signals into an operational brief.

**Does WorldMonitor MCP replace the REST API?**
No. MCP is best for AI clients that need tool discovery and live context. The REST API and bundled OpenAPI spec are better for dashboards, codegen, scheduled jobs, and data pipelines.

**Can I use WorldMonitor MCP without pasting an API key into Claude?**
Yes. Paid tiers can connect through OAuth in supported MCP clients. Server-side scripts can also use `X-WorldMonitor-Key`.

**How do I avoid hallucinated intelligence?**
Force the agent to call structured WorldMonitor tools first, preserve freshness fields, separate observations from interpretation, and ask for next checks instead of unsupported certainty.
