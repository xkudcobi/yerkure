Most alert systems fail because they forward too much. A headline is not an alert. A price tick is not an alert. A single noisy event is not an alert.

A useful geopolitical risk alert tells a team that a relevant state changed: a country moved into a higher risk band, a route became stressed, a cyber signal hit a watched region, a forecast changed materially, or the data you depend on went stale.

WorldMonitor gives developers the data layer for that kind of alerting through REST APIs, MCP tools, seed-health metadata, and structured risk outputs. If your first use case is logistics, the companion guide shows how to [build a supply-chain early-warning system](/blog/posts/build-supply-chain-early-warning-system-api/); if analysts want conversational follow-up, connect alerts to the [WorldMonitor MCP server](/blog/posts/worldmonitor-mcp-server-ai-agents-real-time-intelligence/).

## Alert on state changes, not noise

Start with this rule:

```text
Send an alert only when the recipient can take a different action because of it.
```

That means you should not alert on every:

- New headline
- New aircraft position
- New vessel position
- Commodity quote update
- Social media spike

Alert on combined or decision-relevant conditions:

| Alert type | Trigger example |
|---|---|
| Country risk | Watchlist country moves from watch to elevated or high |
| Advisory | Advisory provenance flips to live high-risk input |
| Chokepoint | Route status worsens and transit counts confirm stress |
| Energy | Fuel shortages plus route stress plus price move |
| Cyber | IOC or outage spike in a watched country or supplier region |
| Forecast | Probability field changes beyond a configured threshold |
| Freshness | Required seed becomes stale or unavailable |

## Pick REST or MCP

Use REST when the alert pipeline is deterministic. Use MCP when an AI agent is deciding which tools to call and writing the final explanation.

| Approach | Best for |
|---|---|
| REST API | Scheduled jobs, backend alert workers, typed clients, predictable thresholds |
| MCP | Analyst assistants, Claude/Cursor workflows, dynamic follow-up questions |
| Dashboard links | Human triage after an alert |

For production Slack or Teams alerts, REST is usually the spine. MCP can help write the explanation after the threshold fires.

## Minimal architecture

The alert worker needs only five pieces:

1. A watchlist of countries, routes, symbols, and domains.
2. A fetch step that calls WorldMonitor APIs.
3. A state store that remembers yesterday's values.
4. A rules engine that compares current state to prior state.
5. A notifier that posts to Slack, Teams, email, PagerDuty, or a ticket system.

Example watchlist:

```json
{
  "countries": ["TR", "EG", "IL", "IR", "TW", "UA", "MX"],
  "chokepoints": ["strait-of-hormuz", "suez", "bab-el-mandeb", "malacca"],
  "symbols": ["CL=F", "BZ=F", "GC=F", "BTC-USD"],
  "channels": {
    "risk": "#geo-risk",
    "supplyChain": "#supply-chain-alerts",
    "security": "#security-ops"
  }
}
```

## Example rules

Start with a small rule set:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "country-risk-band-up",
    "description": "Country risk band worsened",
    "severity": "elevated",
    "cooldownHours": 12
  },
  {
    "id": "chokepoint-critical",
    "description": "Watched chokepoint moved to critical route stress",
    "severity": "critical",
    "cooldownHours": 6
  },
  {
    "id": "data-stale",
    "description": "Required WorldMonitor seed is stale",
    "severity": "watch",
    "cooldownHours": 24
  }
]
```

Every rule should have a cooldown. Without cooldowns, you will train people to ignore the channel.

## Fetch and compare

This is intentionally simple pseudocode:

```js
async function runCountryRiskAlerts(watchlist, previousState) {
  const alerts = [];

  for (const countryCode of watchlist.countries) {
    const current = await fetchCountryRisk(countryCode);
    const previous = previousState.countryRisk[countryCode];

    if (current.stale) {
      alerts.push({
        type: "data-stale",
        severity: "watch",
        title: `${countryCode} country risk data is stale`,
        evidence: { cached_at: current.cached_at }
      });
      continue;
    }

    if (riskBandRank(current.level) > riskBandRank(previous?.level)) {
      alerts.push({
        type: "country-risk-band-up",
        severity: current.level === "critical" ? "critical" : "elevated",
        title: `${countryCode} country risk worsened to ${current.level}`,
        evidence: {
          score: current.score,
          components: current.components,
          advisoryProvenance: current.advisoryProvenance
        }
      });
    }
  }

  return alerts;
}
```

The important part is not the code style. The important part is that the alert compares state, carries evidence, and treats stale data as its own condition.

## Write alerts people can act on

A good alert has five fields:

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| Title | "Hormuz route risk moved to elevated" |
| Why now | "Transit stress rose and Gulf country risk remains elevated" |
| Evidence | Score, fields, cached time, source names |
| Suggested action | "Review tanker exposure and reroute threshold" |
| Link | Dashboard, docs, or internal runbook |

Slack message template:

```text
Risk alert: Hormuz route risk moved to elevated

Why now:
- Chokepoint status worsened since last run
- Energy disruptions remain active
- Brent moved beyond the internal 3-day threshold

Evidence:
- cached_at: 2026-06-10T08:00:00Z
- stale: false
- source: WorldMonitor chokepoint + energy + market data

Suggested action:
Review Gulf route exposure before the next logistics cutoff.
```

## Add an AI summary after the rule fires

Do not let an LLM decide whether a critical alert exists without structured rules. Let the rule fire first, then ask an AI agent to summarize the evidence.

Good agent instruction:

```text
Summarize this alert for an operations channel. Use only the provided WorldMonitor fields. Separate observed signals from interpretation. Include freshness and one suggested next check. Do not add facts that are not in the payload.
```

This gives you readable alerts without surrendering the trigger logic to a model.

## Freshness is an alert too

Data freshness is operational. If a route-risk workflow depends on market, energy, and chokepoint data, stale or missing seed data should show up in the channel before people act on old context.

WorldMonitor exposes freshness through cache fields and health endpoints. Use them to gate alerts:

- If a required dataset is stale, mark downstream alerts as degraded.
- If the freshness endpoint reports a critical seed failure, send a data-quality alert.
- If data is stale but risk worsened anyway, include both facts.

## Rollout plan

1. Start with one Slack or Teams channel.
2. Pick a focused set of countries and chokepoints.
3. Run the worker silently for one week.
4. Review would-have-fired alerts with analysts.
5. Add cooldowns and suppress noisy rules.
6. Turn on posting for elevated and critical only.
7. Review false positives every Friday.

That last step is the work. Alerting gets better through calibration, not clever copy.

Before production rollout, verify payload and lifecycle behavior against the official [Slack incoming-webhook documentation](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) and Microsoft's [Teams webhooks and connectors documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/what-are-webhooks-and-connectors).

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is a geopolitical risk alert?**
A geopolitical risk alert is a structured notification that a relevant country, route, market, cyber, conflict, or data-freshness state changed enough to require human attention.

**Should Slack alerts be generated by an AI agent?**
Use deterministic rules for alert triggers. Use an AI agent only to summarize evidence and suggest next checks after a rule fires.

**Which WorldMonitor data should I alert on first?**
Start with country risk band changes, chokepoint status changes, stale data, sanctions pressure changes, cyber or infrastructure spikes, and high-confidence route or energy signals.

**How do I prevent alert fatigue?**
Alert only on state changes, require combined signals for noisy domains, add cooldowns, suppress repeated alerts, and review false positives every week.

**The best alert pipeline does not make your team read more. It helps them notice the few changes that deserve a decision.**
