A supply chain early warning dashboard should answer one question before the weekly operations meeting: which routes, commodities, suppliers, or countries need attention now?

WorldMonitor is useful here because it does not treat supply chain risk as a single feed. It connects maritime chokepoints, port activity, fuel shortages, energy disruptions, customs flows, commodity prices, trade policy, natural disasters, conflict events, and country risk into one API surface.

This guide gives you a practical dashboard design you can build with the [WorldMonitor API](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/api-reference) or the [WorldMonitor MCP server](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/mcp-overview). For a narrower implementation path, see the tutorial on how to [build a supply-chain early-warning system](/blog/posts/build-supply-chain-early-warning-system-api/), then add alert delivery with the [Slack and Teams alert workflow](/blog/posts/geopolitical-risk-alerts-slack-teams-worldmonitor-api/).

## The dashboard shape

The most useful supply chain dashboard has five panels:

| Panel | Question it answers | WorldMonitor surface |
|---|---|---|
| Route stress | Are major chokepoints moving normally? | `get_chokepoint_status`, Supply Chain API |
| Country exposure | Are supplier or transit countries deteriorating? | `get_country_risk`, conflict and unrest APIs |
| Energy pressure | Are fuel, gas, electricity, or policy signals worsening? | `get_energy_intelligence`, economic APIs |
| Commodity pressure | Are key inputs moving unusually? | `get_market_data`, commodity quotes |
| Narrative confirmation | Is the risk visible across trusted sources? | `get_news_intelligence`, GDELT/search feeds |

Do not start with 40 charts. Start with this question: "What should the operator do differently today?"

## Pick your watchlist

Before writing code, define a compact watchlist:

```json
{
  "countries": ["CN", "TW", "SG", "AE", "SA", "EG", "TR", "DE", "US"],
  "chokepoints": ["strait-of-hormuz", "suez", "bab-el-mandeb", "panama", "malacca"],
  "commodities": ["CL=F", "BZ=F", "GC=F", "HG=F"],
  "routes": [
    { "name": "East Asia to Europe", "chokepoints": ["malacca", "suez"] },
    { "name": "Gulf energy route", "chokepoints": ["strait-of-hormuz", "bab-el-mandeb"] }
  ]
}
```

This turns WorldMonitor's broad data surface into a dashboard that matches your actual exposure.

## Pull the right indicators

### 1. Chokepoint status

Use chokepoint data for direct route stress. WorldMonitor tracks major corridors such as [Hormuz](https://www.worldmonitor.app/chokepoints/strait-of-hormuz/), [Suez](https://www.worldmonitor.app/chokepoints/suez-canal/), [Malacca](https://www.worldmonitor.app/chokepoints/strait-of-malacca/), [Bab-el-Mandeb](https://www.worldmonitor.app/chokepoints/bab-el-mandeb/), [Panama](https://www.worldmonitor.app/chokepoints/panama-canal/), and others.

MCP path:

```json
{
  "name": "get_chokepoint_status",
  "arguments": {
    "jmespath": "chokepoints[].{name:name, status:status, risk:risk, transit:transitSummary, cached_at:cached_at, stale:stale}"
  }
}
```

REST path: start from the [API reference](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/api-reference) or the [MCP-to-REST mapping](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/mcp-overview#api-coverage) and use the supply-chain and intelligence endpoints behind chokepoint and port activity.

### 2. Country risk

Country risk is the context layer. A port can be open while the surrounding political, sanctions, or conflict environment worsens.

For the transit-country examples in this watchlist, inspect the [Egypt](https://www.worldmonitor.app/countries/egypt/) and [Singapore](https://www.worldmonitor.app/countries/singapore/) profiles before choosing alert thresholds. For each country in your watchlist, pull:

- Country Instability Index score and band
- Component breakdown
- Travel advisory level and provenance
- Sanctions pressure
- Conflict and unrest events

Use `get_country_risk` through MCP or the intelligence REST endpoints.

### 3. Energy and fuel pressure

Energy pressure often turns a local route issue into a global cost issue. Track:

- Fuel shortages
- Active energy disruptions
- Government crisis policies
- Gas storage
- Electricity-price or fuel-price signals
- Oil and gas market moves

The `get_energy_intelligence` MCP tool bundles much of this into a single call.

### 4. Commodity and market pressure

Supply chain teams should not wait for finance to tell them that input prices moved. Pull key commodity quotes and decide which price moves should matter operationally.

Example thresholds:

| Signal | Watch condition |
|---|---|
| Brent or WTI | 3-day move above 5% |
| Copper | 7-day move above 4% |
| Gold | Stress proxy rising while equities fall |
| Gulf indices | Regional pressure near energy routes |
| FX | Supplier-country currency move above internal hedge threshold |

### 5. Narrative confirmation

Do not alert on one noisy datapoint. Use news intelligence to confirm whether multiple sources are talking about the same risk.

Good alert logic:

```text
Alert if route stress is high AND at least one of:
- country risk band worsened
- energy disruption count rose
- commodity moved beyond threshold
- cross-source news confirms the route or country
```

## Build a simple risk score

You can start with a transparent score instead of a black-box model:

```text
routeRisk =
  0.35 * chokepointStress +
  0.20 * countryRiskMax +
  0.20 * energyPressure +
  0.15 * commodityPressure +
  0.10 * newsConfirmation
```

Then convert the score into actions:

| Score | Label | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 0-30 | Normal | Keep routine monitoring |
| 31-55 | Watch | Mention in daily supply chain standup |
| 56-75 | Elevated | Review alternate route or buffer inventory |
| 76-100 | Critical | Escalate to procurement, logistics, and leadership |

Keep every component visible. The operator should know whether the score is high because vessels slowed, fuel risk rose, or news volume spiked.

## Create the daily workflow

A good dashboard becomes more valuable when paired with a routine:

1. Run a 06:00 UTC refresh for watchlist countries and chokepoints.
2. Mark stale data before calculating scores.
3. Compare each indicator to its 24-hour and 7-day baseline.
4. Generate a short "changed since yesterday" section.
5. Send only elevated and critical items to Slack, Teams, or email.
6. Archive the raw JSON used for each alert.

The archive is not bureaucracy. It lets you explain why an alert fired two weeks later.

## Use the scenarios API for what-if checks

For severe route exposure, pair live monitoring with scenario analysis. WorldMonitor's [Scenarios API](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/api-scenarios) can run predefined supply-chain disruption scenarios such as Hormuz tanker blockade, Taiwan Strait closure, Suez and Bab-el-Mandeb simultaneous disruption, Panama drought, Baltic grain disruption, and tariff escalation.

Use scenarios when the question shifts from "what is happening?" to "what happens to our exposure if this closes?"

## Dashboard checklist

Before shipping the dashboard internally, check:

- Every alert links to the data fields that triggered it.
- Stale data is labeled before scoring.
- The watchlist is owned by operations, not only engineering.
- Alerts are state changes, not every new headline.
- Route, country, and commodity thresholds are configurable.
- There is a weekly review of false positives and missed events.

## Primary Supply-Chain Sources

Corroborate trade and route signals with primary datasets such as [UN Comtrade](https://comtradeplus.un.org/) and the EIA's [World Oil Transit Chokepoints](https://www.eia.gov/international/content/analysis/special_topics/World_Oil_Transit_Chokepoints/) analysis. Preserve the reporting date because both trade data and route baselines can be revised.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is a supply chain early warning dashboard?**
A supply chain early warning dashboard monitors route, country, energy, commodity, and news signals so teams can see disruption risk before it appears as a missed shipment or surprise price increase.

**Which WorldMonitor APIs matter most for supply chain risk?**
Start with chokepoint status, country risk, energy intelligence, market data, conflict events, and news intelligence. Add scenarios when you need what-if analysis.

**Should I use REST or MCP for this dashboard?**
Use REST for production dashboards and scheduled jobs. Use MCP when an AI agent or analyst assistant needs to choose tools, summarize results, and answer follow-up questions.

**How do I reduce false positives?**
Alert on combined signals: route stress plus country risk, energy pressure, commodity movement, or cross-source news confirmation. Do not alert on every isolated headline.
