 * choice: `provider-error` on every candidate means the pages never loaded,
 * while `validator-rejected` means a price was extracted and then refused —
 * opposite diagnoses that a first-failure or last-failure rule would blur.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION, and the reason the two provider classes sit at the bottom:
 * a page where the primary extractor answered `missing-price` AND the fallback
 * provider errored is reported as `missing-price`, so a fallback-only outage is
 * masked whenever the primary still runs. That is deliberate — the page's own
 * outcome really was "never priced" — but it means this map is not a provider
 * health signal. Provider faults surface here only when they are the whole
 * story for a page; the `[search:provider-cooldown]` log line is what tells you
 * a provider died mid-scrape. (Exactly this masking hid the Exa /contents 400
