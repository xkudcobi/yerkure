/**
 * Returns disabled pins for recovery probing — pins where the scrape job
 * stopped fetching due to the 3-strike disable rule, paired with the new
 * auto-recovery counter (consecutive_in_stock).
 *
 * Without this path, decay restarts after the migration: once a pin gets
 * disabled, getPinnedUrlsForRetailer excludes it forever, the scrape job
 * never observes it again, the recovery counter never increments, and the
 * sticky marker is never cleared. See PR #3627 fresh-eyes review (P1).
 *
 * Bounded by `limit` so a retailer with hundreds of disabled pins doesn't
 * explode the scrape budget. Recovery probes get one fetch per cycle each;
 * with `limit=10` and ~30 disabled pins per retailer, full coverage is
 * ~3 days, recovery to 3-in-stock is ~9 days. Acceptable for a daily-cron
 * scrape; tunable if budget allows.
 *
 * Aggregation queries (worldmonitor.ts buildSpreadSnapshot etc.) continue
 * to filter `pm.pin_disabled_at IS NULL`, so disabled pins probed here
 * still don't affect spread quality during the recovery window.
 *
 * GLOBAL FIFO: ranked CTE picks the OLDEST-disabled match per basket_item
 * (one representative per item to avoid duplicate probes for the same
 * basket entry), then orders globally by pin_disabled_at ASC and applies
 * the LIMIT.
 *
 * NOT to be replaced with `DISTINCT ON (pm.basket_item_id) ORDER BY
 * pm.basket_item_id, pm.pin_disabled_at ASC` — that ORDER BY-then-LIMIT
 * sorts the deduped set by basket_item_id (UUID order), not pin_disabled_at,
 * so the lowest-UUID basket_items would be probed every cycle while
 * higher-UUID disabled pins would starve forever. This bug was caught in
 * PR #3627 review (P1). Ranked-CTE + outer ORDER BY is the right shape.
