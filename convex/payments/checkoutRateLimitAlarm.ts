/**
 * Rate alarm for terminal checkout 429s (#6698).
 *
 * #6027 built the bounded provider-retry ladder in `checkoutRateLimit.ts`.
 * This module watches its TAIL: the checkouts where the ladder ran, was
 * exhausted, and Dodo was still limiting the shared `DODO_API_KEY`, so the
 * buyer got a terminal `429 CHECKOUT_RATE_LIMITED`. Each of those is a
 * paying-intent click that ends in a manual retry.
 *
 * Why the signal is recorded server-side rather than read out of Sentry:
 * the browser event (`WORLDMONITOR-Y1`, level `info`) is emitted by the
 * client SDK after the fetch resolves, so it is subject to ad-blocking,
 * client sampling and project inbound filters, and it pages nobody. The
 * Convex action is the single choke point BOTH entry points funnel through
 * (`createCheckout` and the relay's `internalCreateCheckout`), so counting
 * here cannot miss an occurrence the buyer actually experienced.
 *
 * Shape: one row per terminal 429, evaluated on insert against a rolling
 * 24h burst threshold and a rolling 7d drift threshold. Crossing either one
 * emits a structured `console.error`, which Convex auto-Sentry forwards as an
 * error-level event — the same ops channel `reportDodoWebhookFailure` and the
 * refund alert already use. Below threshold the row is recorded silently, so
 * today's ~0.5/day floor never pages.
 *
 * Thresholds, their false-alarm rates, and the named owner are documented in
 * `docs/payments-checkout-rate-limit-operations.md`. Change them there too.
 *
 * Known bound: recording reads a bounded range of the `by_occurredAt` index in
 * the same transaction as its insert, so two terminal 429s landing at the same
 * instant contend on OCC and Convex retries them. At the observed rate
 * (~0.5/day) that never happens, and if a storm ever exhausts the retries the
 * caller's fail-open wrapper reports the dropped write as its own ops signal —
 * the alarm degrades loudly, not silently.
