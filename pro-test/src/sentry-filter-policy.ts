  // Android WebView's Java-bridge errors. Chromium's `android_webview` wraps a
  // failed `@JavascriptInterface` call as `Error invoking <method>: <reason>`,

  // in production, and both are enumerated here:
  //   WORLDMONITOR-117  `Error invoking enableButtonsClickedMetaDataLogging: Java object is gone`
  //   WORLDMONITOR-126  `Error invoking log: Java bridge method invocation error`
  // The first is an in-app browser's chrome script calling a bridge whose Java
  // object was already collected or detached, typically during `beforeunload`
  // (Instagram 415 on Android 13). The second is an injected `scanForForms`
  // autofill scan on Chrome Mobile 153 / Android 10, reaching Sentry through
  // the SDK's `setTimeout` instrumentation. Neither method name nor either
  // sentence appears anywhere in this bundle, and a pure-web bundle owns no
  // `@JavascriptInterface` object at all, so neither can ever be ours.
  //
  // Already suppressed on the dashboard (`src/bootstrap/sentry-init.ts`, which
  // enumerates both reasons); the two surfaces run separate Sentry clients, so
  // a missing marketing copy is what lets these through with infra-only frames
  // (the `/pro/assets/sentry-*.js` chunk plus `<anonymous>`), which
  // `marketingBeforeSend`'s frame gates cannot act on. That gap produced
  // WORLDMONITOR-117, and again WORLDMONITOR-126 after #7356 copied only the
  // first reason across.
  //
  // The reasons stay ENUMERATED rather than matched by a slot: a Chromium
  // reason we have not seen should surface as a new issue and be added
  // deliberately, which is the safe failure direction — under-suppression
  // announces itself, over-suppression does not.
  //
  // Anchored to the whole sentence, as the dashboard entry has been since
  // #7357. `ignoreErrors` is frame-blind, so an unanchored substring also
  // drops any first-party message that happens to CONTAIN the
  // phrase (`Our Java object is gone`) even when its stack points straight at
  // `/pro/assets/*.js` — the observability blind spot this array exists to
  // avoid. Only the complete Chromium shape is third-party by construction, so
  // only that shape is suppressed; the method name varies per host-app bridge,
  // so it is matched by shape rather than pinned to the one observed
  // (PR #7354 review).
  //
  // The method slot is "anything but whitespace or a colon", NOT `[\w$]+`:
  // Java identifiers are not ASCII-only (`@JavascriptInterface
  // obtenirDonnées()` is legal, and Chromium emits the same sentence for it)
  // while JavaScript's `\w` is, so an ASCII slot silently misses them. Widening
  // it cannot loosen the rule — the envelope is anchored at both ends and the
  // reasons are enumerated, so this matches only if our own bundle emits a
  // whole Chromium sentence. Java method names hold no colon, so excluding
  // one keeps the slot off the reason separator (PR #7356 review).
  /^Error invoking [^\s:]+: (?:Java object is gone|Java bridge method invocation error)$/,
  // iOS in-app WebView native bridge. The host app injects `sendDataToNative` /
  // `sendPageHideMessage` into the document and they dereference
  // `window.webkit.messageHandlers`, which only exists when a WKWebView host
  // registered a script-message handler — so it is undefined in the plain
  // browsers those in-app views also run. Neither identifier appears anywhere
  // in either bundle, and this array's sibling `WKWebView API client did not
  // respond to this postMessage` entry covers the same injected bridge from
  // the other direction. Already suppressed on the dashboard since
  // WORLDMONITOR-KJ (`src/bootstrap/sentry-init.ts`); the two surfaces run
  // separate Sentry clients, so the marketing copy was the gap that let
  // WORLDMONITOR-108 through.
  /webkit\.messageHandlers/,
  // A bare `jQuery` global reference from an injected script.
  // WORLDMONITOR-11F is the shape: `ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined` on
  // Firefox 148 / Linux, sent by `sentry.javascript.react` with a null release,
  // whose single frame is the prerendered welcome document itself
  // (`https://www.worldmonitor.app/` line 1, column 445).
  //
  // The licence is the IDENTIFIER, not the frame — deliberately, because on
  // this surface the document frame proves nothing (see
  // MARKETING_DOCUMENT_FRAME: welcome.html's WebMCP bootstrap and
  // prerender.mjs's DEFERRED_STYLES_SCRIPT are executable inline script the
  // browser attributes to the same URL). A `ReferenceError: <name> is not
  // defined` can only be thrown by code that reads `<name>` as a BARE
  // identifier, and no first-party source on this surface — `pro-test/src`, the
  // `shared/` leaves it imports, or either inline script — contains one for
  // `jQuery`. The one `jQuery` token in the shipped marketing output is
  // UAParser's optional-plugin hookup inside the bundled Clerk chunk,
  // `i.jQuery || i.Zepto`: a guarded PROPERTY read on the global object, which
  // evaluates to `undefined` and cannot raise a ReferenceError. So the throw is
  // third-party by construction, which is what makes a frame-blind
  // `ignoreErrors` entry safe here where `marketingBeforeSend`'s frame gates —
  // handed one document frame — could not act at all.
  //
  // Already suppressed on the dashboard (`/jQuery is not defined/` in
  // `src/bootstrap/sentry-init.ts`); the two surfaces run separate Sentry
  // clients, which is the same gap that let WORLDMONITOR-15/-102/-107/-108/
  // -10N/-10T/-117 through.
  //
  // Anchored to the whole message rather than copying the dashboard's bare
  // substring, for the reason the `Error invoking` entry above spells out:
  // `ignoreErrors` is frame-blind, so an unanchored pattern would also drop a
  // first-party message that merely CONTAINS the phrase, even riding a
  // `/pro/assets/*.js` frame. `tests/pro-sentry-filter-policy.test.mts` pins
  // both the suppression and the bare-identifier scan that licenses it.
  /^jQuery is not defined$/,
  // DuckDuckGo's `content-scope-scripts`. The browser injects its own feature
  // registry into every document and rejects when a configured feature name has
  // no registered implementation — the message is that registry's, phrased
  // `feature named \`<name>\` was not found`. WORLDMONITOR-127 is the shape:
  // DuckDuckGo 18.1 / macOS at `/`, an `onunhandledrejection` capture with a
  // NULL stacktrace, so `marketingBeforeSend`'s frame gates have nothing to act
  // on and only a message rule can reach it.
  //
  // The licence is the whole sentence, not the feature name: the registry, its
  // wording and its features all live in the browser, and `feature named`
  // appears in no marketing first-party source (the guard test pins that scan).
  // A pure-web bundle has no DuckDuckGo feature registry to miss a lookup in,
  // so it can never emit this.
  //
  // The name is SLOTTED rather than enumerated — unlike the `Error invoking`
  // reasons above — because it is a third-party identifier, not a fixed
  // vocabulary we want to review one member at a time: DuckDuckGo adds features
  // per release and each new one would otherwise open a fresh issue with the
  // same disposition. The backticks are matched literally, so a re-quoted
  // future wording reports instead of being swallowed, which is the safe
  // failure direction this file keeps: under-suppression announces itself,
  // over-suppression does not.
  //

  /^feature named `[\w-]+` was not found$/,
  // A synthetic `unhandledrejection` CustomEvent, dispatched by injected script

  // The licence is the CONSTRUCTOR, not the frame: Sentry only writes

  // value is a real `CustomEvent` instance, and the marketing surface never
  // constructs one — `CustomEvent` appears in neither `pro-test/src`, the

  // construct them, e.g. `WM_SESSION_DEGRADED_EVENT`, which is why its own copy
  // of this entry is separately argued). Frame-blind suppression is the only
  // option available anyway: the event carries `stacktrace: null`, so
  // `marketingBeforeSend`'s `!hasFirstParty` gate has nothing to act on.
  //
  // Anchored to the whole synthetic sentence rather than copying the

  /^Event `CustomEvent` \(type=[\w-]+\) captured as promise rejection$/,
  // javascript-obfuscator's hex-suffixed identifier scheme. WORLDMONITOR-11P is

  // Windows at `/`, whose only frames are three `<anonymous>:1` — an injected
  // userscript or extension bundle referencing its own obfuscated global before
  // define. Same class as the `mainWorldSdk` / `extDomain` / `crusoe` entries
  // the dashboard carries.
  //
  // Matched on the identifier so BOTH engine phrasings are covered from one
  // entry — Chromium says `<name> is not defined`, WebKit says `Can't find
  // variable: <name>` — and on the SHAPE rather than the one observed name,
  // because the hex suffix is regenerated on every obfuscation run. `_0x`
  // followed by four or more hex digits is javascript-obfuscator's output
  // convention and nothing else: Vite's esbuild/terser minifier emits
  // single-letter and `$`-prefixed names, never a `_0x` prefix, and the literal
  // appears nowhere in `pro-test/src`, `shared/`, or either inline script.
  //
  // The dashboard has carried only the WebKit half (`/Can't find variable:
  // _0x/`) since #4005; this pass adds the same shape there alongside it.

  // `/pro`, arriving via `onunhandledrejection` with zero frames, breadcrumbs
  // ending at Clerk's `POST /v1/client/sign_ins`.
  //
  // The sentence is emitted by the browser's own `navigator.credentials`

  // surface has none: neither `navigator.credentials` nor
  // `PublicKeyCredential` appears in `pro-test/src`, the `shared/` leaves, or
  // either inline script. The only passkey on this surface is Clerk's own
  // sign-in UI (the `Passkey sign-in` string in `locales/*.json` is marketing
  // copy for it), so the throw belongs to the Clerk SDK on an Electron shell
  // that ships no authenticator — the same disposition as the `ClerkJS:
  // Network error` and `[clerk] failed to load` entries on the dashboard.
  //
  // Anchored to the whole sentence: bare `NotSupportedError` is generic enough
  // that our own bundle could raise it (the dashboard keeps it behind a

  // clicks on its identifier field. Chromium raises it when the platform
  // authenticator service cannot be reached, which only a WebAuthn CALLER can
  // hit. The WebAuthn-free scan that licenses the entry above pins that this
  // surface has none, so the caller is Clerk's sign-in UI. Anchored to the whole
  // sentence for the same reason: bare `NotSupportedError` stays reportable.
  /^(?:Error: )?NotSupportedError: Error connecting to Web Authentication service\.$/,
  // The same WebAuthn surface as the entry above, reached from the other

  // via `onunhandledrejection` with zero frames, breadcrumbs running Clerk's
  // `GET /v1/environment` -> `GET /v1/client` -> a button click ->

  // Chrome serialises `navigator.credentials` requests per page and rejects the

  // (keycloak/keycloak#41037; w3c/webauthn#1790 records that the spec leaves
  // the overlap undefined and that Chrome errors). Clerk's sign-in UI opens
  // exactly that conditional request, so both triggers sit behind the marketing
  // sign-in button and neither is reachable from this bundle to fix.
  //
  // Same licence as the `NotSupportedError` entry above, and it holds twice

  // revenue path to silence one event. Same keep-visible reasoning as the
  // zero-frame stack overflow in WORLDMONITOR-WK.
  //
  // Two of those six, `checkout.ts` and `checkout-transport.ts`, were once

  // an argument about the filter. The rule stays absent on the strength of the
  // other four call sites.
  //
  // The dashboard's gate in `src/bootstrap/sentry-init.ts` (WORLDMONITOR-66/-62)
  // is still not a precedent to copy, though the old reason given here — that
  // the dashboard bundle mints its own DOMException carrying caller frames —
  // was wrong, and cost WORLDMONITOR-Q4. `createTimeoutSignal` only mints one
  // on the pre-Baseline-2024 fallback path, and stamps it with the native
  // header-only stack; every current engine takes the native
  // `AbortSignal.timeout` branch instead. Both produce the same frameless
  // rejection seen here (Chromium 141: `stack` is the header line alone).
  // What separates the two surfaces is that the dashboard gate exempts any
  // event carrying a first-party `kind` tag, which its checkout and panel
  // reports set. No call site on THIS surface sets one, so the gate would go
  // back to suppressing owned failures. Adding it here means tagging the six

  // One dependency no test can pin: `@clerk/clerk-js` bundles wallet SDKs, and
