# 🌍 Self-Hosting World Monitor

Run the full World Monitor stack locally with Docker/Podman.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Docker** or **Podman** (rootless works fine)
- **Docker Compose** or **podman-compose** (`pip install podman-compose` or `uvx podman-compose`)
- **Node.js 22+** (for running seed scripts on the host)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/koala73/worldmonitor.git
cd worldmonitor
npm install

# 2. Generate the REQUIRED secrets. Without these the stack will not start
#    (see the "Required Environment Variables" table below).
echo "RELAY_SHARED_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" >> .env
echo "REDIS_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 32)"      >> .env
echo "REDIS_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)"         >> .env
echo "WM_SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)"   >> .env

# 3. Start the stack
docker compose up -d        # or: uvx podman-compose up -d

# 4. Seed data into Redis
./scripts/run-seeders.sh

# 5. Open the dashboard
open http://localhost:3000
```

The dashboard works out of the box with public data sources (earthquakes, weather, conflicts, etc.). API keys unlock additional data feeds.

## Documentation indexing

The bundled documentation identifies `https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs` as its
original location. `docs/docs.json` sets this canonical base for Mintlify, and
`src/config/docs-locale-seo.ts` uses `DOCS_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` to produce an absolute,
page-specific canonical and language links.

Deployments that run `middleware.ts` also return `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` for docs
HTML on hosts other than the configured public host. This includes preview
hosts. The policy also applies to HEAD and 304 responses, and preserves existing
robots restrictions. It does not stop people from reading the docs. Static
exports and proxies that bypass this middleware must set their own indexing
headers; they retain the canonical metadata only if they preserve it.

Inspect canonical URLs before publishing a static export. The pinned Mintlify
CLI currently includes `/src/_props` in local preview and export canonicals;
that local output does not establish the hosted provider's URL behavior.

For a fork that publishes its own documentation, deliberately update the
canonical base in `docs/docs.json`, `DOCS_PUBLIC_ORIGIN`, and the docs upstream and
reverse-proxy routes (`DOCS_UPSTREAM_ORIGIN` and `vercel.json`) together. Configure
the provider's base path to match. Check the resulting canonical URLs, language
links, structured data, sitemap, and indexing headers before requesting indexing.
Do not derive the canonical origin from the incoming request or a forwarded-host
header. Keep shared caches separated by host and preserve the response's `Vary`
selectors.

Canonical metadata is a search-engine signal, not a guarantee. A proxy can rewrite
or remove it, and older deployed copies will not receive changes to this repo.

## 🔐 Required Environment Variables

These must be set before `docker compose up -d`, or one of the containers will exit on boot.

| Variable | Purpose | How to generate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RELAY_SHARED_SECRET` | Authenticates every non-public request the dashboard makes to the AIS relay. The relay refuses to start without it. | `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | Redis AUTH password (`--requirepass`). The Redis container refuses to start without it; the REST proxy uses it in its upstream connection string. | `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `REDIS_TOKEN` | Bearer token the REST proxy (`redis-rest`) requires on every request, and the value the app sends as `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`. The proxy and app containers refuse to start without it. | `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `WM_SESSION_SECRET` | Signs the anonymous browser session used by self-hosted API routes. The app container refuses to start without it. | `openssl rand -hex 32` |

> Earlier releases shipped `wm-local-token` as a default for the REST token. That default has been removed (#3804) — the proxy was only reachable from `127.0.0.1:8079` so external exposure required a hostile `docker-compose.override.yml`, but any user who flipped that binding to `0.0.0.0` was instantly authenticated by a publicly documented string. Fresh installs and existing clones both need to set `REDIS_TOKEN`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, and `WM_SESSION_SECRET` in `.env` from this release onward.

## Self-hosted API authentication

Docker mode (`LOCAL_API_MODE=docker`) has no Clerk or Convex entitlement backend. The dashboard still mints an anonymous `wms_` session signed with `WM_SESSION_SECRET`.

Native administration routes under `/api/local-` return `403` in Docker mode, including configuration updates, secret validation, and local status/debug controls. The internal sidecar token does not grant administrator access through nginx. Change operator settings through Compose environment variables or Docker secrets, then recreate the app container. Desktop administration remains available through the native app.

- Only `GET /api/intelligence/v1/get-country-intel-brief` accepts that session as the authentication boundary. The handler still returns the shared (non-premium) brief.
- Direct-LLM spend on that route is capped at 50 calls per UTC day per client IP. nginx stamps `X-Real-IP` from `$remote_addr`, so a caller cannot rotate the header to reset the cap. Rotating the session token also does not reset spend.
- Every other premium route still requires an API key or a Clerk entitlement. Cloud deployments do not set `LOCAL_API_MODE=docker` and keep key plus entitlement enforcement on this route too.

If another reverse proxy sits in front of the World Monitor container, set
`WM_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` to that proxy's IP address or network. Separate multiple
values with commas, for example `WM_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS=172.20.0.0/16,2001:db8::/32`.
World Monitor then uses `X-Forwarded-For` only when it comes through those trusted
peers, and nginx resolves the original client address recursively. Invalid values
stop the container at startup. Leave this variable unset for direct connections;
never trust a network that can contain untrusted clients, because those clients
could then supply a false forwarded address and evade the per-IP quota.

> Need to bring the relay up without auth for local debugging? Set `I_UNDERSTAND_THIS_DISABLES_AUTH=true` (the deprecated `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_RELAY=true` is still accepted). The relay will log a loud `[SECURITY]` warning at boot and every 5 minutes, and every non-public route will be reachable by anyone who can hit the port — **never use this on an internet-reachable host.**

## 🤖 Using the MCP server

The bundled MCP server is served at `/api/mcp` on your own stack. It authenticates
with the `X-WorldMonitor-Key` header, validated against `WORLDMONITOR_VALID_KEYS`
(the OAuth path is hosted-only). Generate a key, put it in `.env`, and restart:

```bash
YOUR_KEY="wm_$(openssl rand -hex 20)"
echo "WORLDMONITOR_VALID_KEYS=$YOUR_KEY" >> .env
docker compose up -d
```

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -H "X-WorldMonitor-Key: $YOUR_KEY" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

The bundled nginx proxy supplies `X-WorldMonitor-Local-Token` for transport
between nginx and the sidecar. It preserves the client's `Authorization`
header. The transport token does not grant MCP access: operator keys still
use `X-WorldMonitor-Key`, and OAuth requires the hosted identity services.

## 🌱 Seeding Data

The seed scripts fetch upstream data and write it to Redis. They run **on the host** (not inside the container) and need the Redis REST proxy to be running.

```bash
# Run all seeders (auto-sources API keys from docker-compose.override.yml)
./scripts/run-seeders.sh
```

**⚠️ Important:** Redis data persists across container restarts via the `redis-data` volume, but is lost on `docker compose down -v`. Re-run the seeders if you remove volumes or see stale data.

To automate, add a cron job:

```bash
# Re-seed every 30 minutes
*/30 * * * * cd /path/to/worldmonitor && ./scripts/run-seeders.sh >> /tmp/wm-seeders.log 2>&1
```

**Per-seeder timeout (`SEED_TIMEOUT`):** standalone seeders are each wrapped in a
wall-clock cap so one hung upstream can't starve the rest of the run. It defaults
to `1800` (30 min); override with `SEED_TIMEOUT=<seconds>`, or `SEED_TIMEOUT=0` to
disable. Bundle seeders (`seed-bundle-*.mjs`) are exempt — they already bound each
section internally. Requires the `timeout` command (GNU coreutils); if it's absent
the cap is silently skipped.

### 🔧 Manual seeder invocation

If you prefer to run seeders individually:

```bash
# Source .env so REDIS_TOKEN (and any API keys it holds) become available.
# Quick-start puts REDIS_TOKEN in .env, not in your shell — without this,
# the next line fails-loud with "REDIS_TOKEN: parameter null or not set".
set -a; . ./.env; set +a

export UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=http://localhost:8079
export UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="${REDIS_TOKEN:?set REDIS_TOKEN in .env first}"
node scripts/seed-earthquakes.mjs
node scripts/seed-military-flights.mjs
# ... etc
```

`./scripts/run-seeders.sh` auto-sources `REDIS_TOKEN` from `.env`, so the wrapper is the simpler path. Use the manual form only when iterating on a single seeder.

## Revoking a news item

Sometimes a headline has to come down now — a retracted story, a defamatory
claim, a wrong attribution. The digest keeps a narrow, versioned set of
suppressed URLs and filters against it at **read** time, on every path that can
return bytes: a fresh build, a digest cache hit, the durable last-good
snapshot, the warm-isolate replay, the country brief, and the chat analyst.

```bash
# Source .env so REDIS_TOKEN is available, then point at the REST proxy.
set -a; . ./.env; set +a
export UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=http://localhost:8079
export UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="$REDIS_TOKEN"

# 1. Suppress the URL. Match is EXACT string equality on the item's `link` —
#    scheme, trailing slash, and query string all count. Copy the URL from the
#    API response rather than retyping it.
curl -s -X POST "$UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL/pipeline" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '[["SADD","news:digest:revoked-urls:v1","https://example.com/retracted-story"]]'
```

That single `SADD` is enough for everything served out of Redis — no key
deletion is required, because suppression happens on read.

**Two things it does not do**, both of which matter during an incident:

1. **It does not evict shared caches.** `/api/news/v1/list-feed-digest` is
   served with `s-maxage=1800` and `CDN-Cache-Control: s-maxage=3600`. Once a
   revocation is live the endpoint stops feeding shared caches, but copies
   already stored survive. **Purge the CDN for that path** if you have one in
   front of the stack. A purely local Docker stack has no CDN and can skip this.
2. **It does not force a rebuild.** The existing digest keeps being rebuilt on
   its normal ~900s cycle. To rebuild immediately:

   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST "$UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL/pipeline" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '[["DEL","news:digest:v1:full:en"],["DEL","news:digest:lastgood:v1:full:en"]]'
   ```

   Note the key version is **v1**. Repeat per `<variant>:<lang>` scope you serve.

To lift a revocation, `SREM` the same URL — stored bodies are kept unfiltered on
purpose, so the item reappears on the next read without waiting for a rebuild.

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL/pipeline" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '[["SREM","news:digest:revoked-urls:v1","https://example.com/retracted-story"]]'
```

> If the revocation set cannot be read at all (Redis erroring, not merely
> absent), every serving path fails **closed** — it serves nothing rather than
> serving content it could not check. A stack with no Redis configured is a
> different case: there is no suppression store to consult, so serving proceeds
> normally.

> **`redis-rest` request body limit**: the proxy accepts request bodies up to **16 MB**,
> overridable with `SRH_MAX_BODY_BYTES` (bytes) on the `redis-rest` service. The default is
> sized for the seeders: every seeder publishing through `atomicPublish` is capped at 5 MB per
> key (`MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES` in `scripts/_seed-utils.mjs`), and `atomicPublish` sends that payload
> as a JSON string nested inside `["SET", key, <payload>, "EX", ttl]`, so escaping makes the
> wire body larger than the payload.
>
> An over-limit body is answered with `413 Payload Too Large` and logged by the proxy, so a
> rejection shows up as a clear HTTP status in the seeder log *and* a matching line in
> `docker compose logs redis-rest` — never a bare `EPIPE`-style connection error. That holds at
> any value you set, so lowering the limit is safe to diagnose. The `redis-rest` service also
> carries a `mem_limit`, since the proxy buffers each accepted body in full; raise both together
> if you raise `SRH_MAX_BODY_BYTES`.

## 🔨 Building from Source

```bash
# Frontend only (for development)
# Build /pro first: it is generated by pro-test, not committed (#6898), and the
# root Vite build only copies whatever public/ already contains. Skipping it
# leaves dist/ with no /pro.
npm run build:pro && npx vite build

# Full Docker image
docker build -t worldmonitor:latest -f Dockerfile .

# Rebuild and restart
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
./scripts/run-seeders.sh
```

### ⚠️ Build Notes

- The Docker image uses **Node.js 22 Alpine** for both builder and runtime stages
- Blog site build is skipped in Docker (separate dependencies)
- The runtime stage needs `gettext` (Alpine package) for `envsubst` in the nginx config
- Docker nginx mirrors Vercel's `script-src` policy and does not allow `'unsafe-inline'`; hash-pin any custom inline scripts before adding them to a self-hosted build.
- If you hit `npm ci` sync errors in Docker, regenerate the lockfile with the container's npm version:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/app -w /app node:24-alpine npm install --package-lock-only
  ```

## 🌐 Connecting to External Infrastructure

### Shared Redis (optional)

If you run other stacks that share a Redis instance, connect via an external network:

```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yml
services:
  redis:
    networks:
      - infra_default

networks:
  infra_default:
    external: true
```

### Self-Hosted LLM

Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works (Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp server, etc.):

```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yml
services:
  worldmonitor:
    environment:
      LLM_API_URL: "http://your-host:8000/v1/chat/completions"
      LLM_API_KEY: "your-key"
      LLM_MODEL: "your-model-name"
    extra_hosts:
      - "your-host:192.168.1.100"  # if not DNS-resolvable
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| 📡 `0/55 OK` on health check | Seeders haven't run — `./scripts/run-seeders.sh` |
| 🔴 nginx won't start | Check `podman logs worldmonitor` — likely missing `gettext` package |
| 🔑 Seeders say "Missing UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL" | Stack isn't running, or run via `./scripts/run-seeders.sh` (auto-sets env vars) |
| 📦 `npm ci` fails in Docker build | Lockfile mismatch — regenerate with `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app node:24-alpine npm install --package-lock-only` |
| 🚢 No vessel data | Set `AISSTREAM_API_KEY` in both `worldmonitor` and `ais-relay` services |
| 🔥 No wildfire data | Set `NASA_FIRMS_API_KEY` |
| 🌐 No outage data | Requires `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (paid Radar access) |
