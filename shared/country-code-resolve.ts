/**
 * Resolve an opaque, caller-supplied country designator to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2.
 *
 * Callers that accept a country from an untrusted or non-deterministic source —
 * chiefly the MCP tool layer, where an LLM picks the argument — get one string
 * of unknown kind. It may already be alpha-2 (`IQ`), alpha-3 (`IRQ`), an English
 * name (`Iraq`), or an alias (`UK`, `DRC`, `Burma`). This resolves all of them.
 *
 * It exists because the alternative those callers reached for was
 * `String(x).toUpperCase().slice(0, 2)`, which is silently wrong rather than
 * merely lossy: the downstream proto only enforces `^[A-Z]{2}$`, so a truncated
 * name that happens to yield two letters PASSES validation and returns the wrong
 * country's data. `Iraq` → `IR` answered as Iran, `China` → `CH` as Switzerland,
 * `Israel` → `IS` as Iceland. Only the residue that truncates to something
 * invalid (`''`) ever surfaced as an error (WORLDMONITOR-Y2).
 *
 * Returning `null` for genuinely unresolvable input lets the caller raise a
 * message naming the value, which an agent can act on — unlike a wrong answer.
 *
 * Edge-safe: pure data + string work over two JSON maps, no filesystem reads.
 * The sibling resolvers cannot serve this layer — `shared/country-name-to-iso2.cjs`
 * is CommonJS (and has no alpha-3 step), `scripts/_country-resolver.mjs` reads
 * from disk and needs the caller to have already split iso2/iso3/name apart, and
 * `src/services/country-geometry.ts` is browser-only and built from loaded map
 * geometry.

// guard and escape as a NON-STRING despite this module's `string | null`
