/**
 * Publisher-family resolution for corroboration counting (#6428).
 *
 * A cluster's `sources` array holds FEED LABELS, and a feed label is not a
 * publisher: `BBC World`, `BBC Africa` and `BBC Persian` are three labels for
 * one newsroom, and `Reuters World` + `Reuters US` + `Reuters Business` are
 * three labels for one wire. Counting labels let a single story reprinted
 * across one publisher's own editions clear a "two independent sources" gate.
 * Every corroboration gate must count families instead.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED, in the direction that never invents independence:
 *   - an unmapped label is its OWN family. A new feed is never silently
 *     folded into an existing publisher, and it never disappears from the
 *     count either — it just cannot claim to corroborate anything but itself.
 *   - singleton family ids are namespaced (`label:<name>`) so they can never
 *     collide with a curated family id.
 *
 * Cross-publisher syndication (#6430): the server ingest parser may carry the
 * RSS `<source>` element — the originating publisher Google News stamps per
 * item — as `originPublisher`. Corroboration consumers must call
 * `publisherFamilyForItem`, which accepts that origin only when the parser
 * marked the feed as an explicitly configured trusted aggregator. Ordinary
 * feeds fall back to their server-configured label, so upstream text cannot
 * manufacture independent families. To let a trusted origin NAME ("Reuters",
 * "Associated Press") land in the same family as the feed labels it
 * syndicates through, each curated family's `publisher` name is indexed
 * alongside its labels. An unknown origin name stays its own singleton family
 * — same fail-closed direction as an unmapped label.
 *
 * REMAINING LIMIT — origin names outside the curated set. "BBC News" from a
 * Google News <source> does not fold into the 'bbc' family unless curated
 * (no fuzzy matching, by design), and direct non-Google-News feeds mostly
 * carry no <source> element at all — for those the feed label remains the
 * best available publisher signal.
 */
/**
 * Curated label -> publisher family. Only families with 2+ labels appear; an
 * unmapped label is its own family by construction (see publisherFamilyFor).
 *
 * INLINE ON PURPOSE — do not move this table back into a .json.
 * This module is reached by four runtimes: the Railway seeder (nixpacks,
 * rootDirectory=scripts), the Vercel handler bundle via
 * server/worldmonitor/news/v1/list-feed-digest.ts, the Vite browser bundle,
 * and plain `node --test`. The two JSON-import forms are mutually
 * incompatible across them — `with { type: 'json' }` breaks the Vercel
 * bundle, and a bare JSON import throws ERR_IMPORT_ATTRIBUTE_MISSING under
 * Node 22+. shared/ticker-extract.js:20-30 records that burn, and
 * tests/no-json-import-attributes-on-edge-path.test.mjs now enforces it.
 * A literal is the one form that works everywhere.
