// Report definition for the July 2026 Strait of Hormuz transit report — the
// pilot of the /research/ report family (issue #5668).
//
// This file is the versioned editorial contract for one report edition: page
// metadata, layer-labelled prose, named sources, and limitations. Quantitative
// values are NEVER hand-written here — prose references computed metrics as
// `{{m:<metricId>}}` tokens, which scripts/build-research-reports.mjs resolves
// from the committed snapshot named below. An unresolved token fails the build
// (fail closed), so published numbers cannot drift from the data.
//
// Evidence layers follow the #5668 contract: observed transport data, derived
// analysis, and news context stay separately labelled and are never blended
// into a combined score. Layers this edition does not collect are declared in
// `layersNotCovered` and rendered as explicit gaps, not omissions.

    'Topic selected after a 2026-07-26 spot check found no authoritative public source for daily Strait of Hormuz transit counts — the exact reviewed query q07 in the visibility baseline (use-case intent, chokepoints page family, IMF PortWatch as named source).',
    'The 2026-07-27 visibility baseline shows the category query already earning AI citations (4/4 platform mentions, 3/4 direct) while use-case queries have no observed visibility, so the next authority asset belongs on a use-case surface.',
    'The baseline’s expansion gate allows at most one evidence-rich report experiment before credentialed demand data arrives; this pilot is that single experiment.',
