/**
 * Attribution rider — the accompaniment obligation, carried by construction.
 *
 * Restricted VALUES are already redacted before anything reaches this module.
 * `requiresRedistributableProvidersForDirectRpc` (server/_shared/provider-
 * redistribution.ts) is true for every MCP call, which drives
 * `enforceCommodityRedistributionPolicy` and `decideIndicatorRawRedistribution`
 * to blank or drop whatever may not be redistributed. What survives to the
 * projection boundary is redistribution-PERMITTED. The only residual licence
 * obligation on those payloads is that the attribution travels with the values.
 *
 * A JMESPath projection can detach a value from the licence fields that sit
 * beside it in the unprojected payload. The old answer was a roster of tools
 * that refused projection outright; the roster protected two tools that carry
 * no attribution at all and missed three that do. This module replaces it: a
 * licence-bearing tool declares ONE JMESPath expression that extracts its
 * source list, and the dispatcher re-attaches that list to every projected
 * response. The projection can no longer separate the two because the rider is
 * merged AFTER `jmespath.search` — no expression can name it, reach it, or
 * remove it.
 *
 * Both surfaces import this module: `api/mcp/dispatch.ts` (keyed on the tool's
 * `_attribution`) and `server/gateway.ts` (keyed on the request pathname, via
 * `REST_ATTRIBUTION_EXPRESSIONS`).
 *
 * It lives in `shared/`, not `server/_shared/`, because `shared/` is the only
 * directory reachable from every surface that needs the policy. `api/mcp/`
 * could import `server/_shared/` — 13 of its modules already do — but the
 * Railway seeder images build with `root_dir=scripts` and package only
 * `scripts/` and `shared/`, so a relative import that escapes into `server/`
 * is `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` at runtime there (see the rule stated at length in
 * `scripts/_simulation-queue-constants.mjs` and pinned by
 * `tests/scripts-railway-nixpacks-no-escape-import.test.mts`). A licence
 * policy is exactly the kind of thing a seeder or a plain-node check will want
 * to read, so it goes where all three can load it.
