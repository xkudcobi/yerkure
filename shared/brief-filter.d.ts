 * dropped story with the drop reason and available metadata. The
 * callback runs before the `continue` that skips the story — callers
 * can use it to aggregate per-user drop counters without altering
 * filter behaviour.
 *
 * Stories are re-ordered BEFORE the cap using deterministic editorial
 * signals first: topic block's highest eligible severity, count at that
 * severity, eligible block size, and score. This intentionally favors
 * concentrated top severity before breadth: a block with two critical
 * stories sorts ahead of a block with one critical plus many high
 * stories. `rankedStoryHashes` remains a tie-breaker inside similarly
 * severe/sized blocks, matched by short-hash prefix (≥4 chars), except
 * for the rank-0 lead coherence override: an entity-corroborated
 * flashpoint-diplomacy story selected first by the synthesis ranks
 * ahead of severity-only ordering so the lead and card #1 align. This
 * keeps critical topic clusters contiguous instead of letting model
 * ranking pull unrelated singletons above them.
 *
 * `maxPerSourceTopic` (U5, default 2) caps how many stories sharing
 * the same `(source, category)` pair can survive into a single brief.
 * Pass `Infinity` to disable. The cap runs AFTER deterministic
 * severity/topic ordering so the strongest sibling of any pair
 * survives. Stories beyond the cap are dropped with
 * `onDrop({ reason: 'source_topic_cap' })`.
