// than the ranking/score TTL (12h / 6h) so refreshRankingAggregate() can keep
// the ranking alive between Railway cron fires. A 2h interval → 96min skip
// window, so hourly Railway fires run this ~every 2h. The seeder is cheap on
// warm runs (~5-10s: intervals recompute + one /refresh=1 HTTP + 2 verify
// GETs); the expensive warm path only runs when scores are actually missing.
//
// timeoutMs note: section timeouts are sized against measured runtime and each seeder's own
// internal deadline, NOT against Railway's container cap. #6556: every section
// here was declared at 600-900s, which is above the 570s bundle budget once the
// runner's 10s kill grace is added, so the admission check deferred all three
// on every tick and exited 0 — the service published nothing for six hours
// under a green badge. A timeout above the container cap never bounded anything
// anyway: Railway SIGKILLs at 10 minutes, taking the logs with it.

  // at 240s rather than finishing. That is not a regression: the old 600s
  // timeout sat above Railway's 10-minute container kill, so the same run died
  // by container SIGKILL with its logs lost. Giving that phase its own budget
  // (like Food-Stocks' fetchPhaseTimeoutMs) is tracked separately.
