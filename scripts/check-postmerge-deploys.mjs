// Alarms on a failed post-merge production deploy. (#6376)
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// `main` can be green while a production deploy never happened. Convex Deploy
// and Deploy Railway Reconcile Control both run on push to `main` and both
// failed there with main staying green:
//
//   - Convex Deploy failed on 5605edcbd (#6232) with `InvalidModules ...
//     import.meta unsupported`; the whole convex/ change set sat in main and
//     never reached Convex production. Fixed by #6373 — but nothing except a
//     human reading the Actions tab surfaced it.
//   - Deploy Railway Reconcile Control failed on d130a957f (#6325) and
//     eb4bb09c1 (#6326) because five required secrets did not exist.
//
// These are post-merge deploys, so they cannot gate the PR that causes them.
// The deploy gate's `required` list cannot include them either (they run on
// main pushes, not PRs). What they need is an alarm: a scheduled monitor that
// fails loudly when the newest run of one of these workflows on main is not
// green.
//
// Why scan run history instead of listening for workflow_run events: the
// event fires only on completion, so a workflow that never runs (deleted,
// broken trigger) produces no event at all. A time-bounded scan of the runs
// API sees that as "no run on main in the window" — an alarm.
//
// DIRECTION OF FAILURE
//
// A verified failed deploy is ALARM and fails the job. GitHub transport
// unreadability after the retry budget (TLS, DNS, timeout, 5xx) is UNKNOWN:
// visible as an Actions warning, never a claim that a deploy failed, and it
// does not fail the job. Local proof failures (git, missing `gh`) and GitHub
// 4xx answers are ALARM and still fail the job. An unmatched case that means
// HEALTHY is the same defect in a new place.
