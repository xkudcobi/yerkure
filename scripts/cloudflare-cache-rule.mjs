/**
 * The Cloudflare cache rule that makes the crawlable corpus edge-cacheable (#7659).
 *
 * ## Why a rule, when the origin header is already right
 *
 * Every corpus route answers with `CDN-Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=600,
 * stale-while-revalidate=60` — tests/deploy-config.test.mjs has asserted that on
 * every family for a while. Production still answered `cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC`
 * on 14/14 sampled routes, and CrUX TTFB sat flat at ~725 ms across 25 windows.
 *
 * The cause is a zone cache rule, "Bypass cache - WWW documents", that sets
 * `cache: false` for every extensionless/HTML path on www.worldmonitor.app. Once
 * a cache rule declares a response ineligible, origin cache headers get no vote,
 * so no vercel.json change can reach this. The zone already contains the shape of
 * the answer: "WWW entry HTML - use origin CDN cache headers" sits after the
 * bypass and is why `/` and `/dashboard` — and only those two — ever report HIT.
 *
 * This script generates the same shape for the corpus families, derived from
 * CONTENT_CORPUS_PREFIXES so the rule cannot drift away from the header rules it
 * mirrors. Cloudflare evaluates every matching rule in the cache phase in order
 * and the last one to set a field wins, so the rule is appended: placed before
 * the bypass it would be silently inert.
 *
 * #7747 widened the same rule to the rest of the sitemap-declared document
 * surface, which the bypass had kept DYNAMIC for the same reason: the blog
 * (Astro static output under /blog/), the Mintlify-proxied docs (/docs/), and
 * the root agent text files (/llms.txt, /world-monitor.md, ...). Each needs BOTH
 * halves — the CDN-Cache-Control header in vercel.json for the TTL and a claim
 * here for eligibility. The issue's own diagnosis ("the header is the
 * discriminator") was a correlation: header and rule were derived from the same
 * prefix list, so every route had both or neither.
 *
 * #7804 folded `/` and `/dashboard` in as well and retired the dashboard-managed
 * "WWW entry HTML" rule that had been their answer. That rule set `cache: true`
 * for any query-free GET of the two URLs with none of the guards below, one
 * position before this rule — and Cloudflare takes the LAST matching writer of a
 * field, so a request this rule's guard rejected (`Accept: text/markdown`, which
 * Vercel answers with a markdown rendering of the homepage under the same
 * cacheable header) still found `cache: true` one rule earlier. The guard was
 * inert on the two busiest URLs on the site. A sibling rule outside the
 * generator is invisible to `--check`, so the generator now knows which rules it
 * has superseded (RETIRED_CACHE_RULES) and `--apply` deletes them once the claim
 * has landed.
 *
 * ## Representations Cloudflare cannot tell apart
 *
 * Several of these URLs answer with more than one body. Vercel converts any HTML
 * document to markdown for `Accept: text/markdown` (corpus and blog; the response
 * carries `Vary: accept`); Mintlify does the same for `text/markdown` and
 * `text/plain`, serves an RSC flight for `RSC: 1` or the `next-router-*`
 * headers, and both match media types case-insensitively (measured 2026-09-05:
 * `Accept: TEXT/MARKDOWN` answers text/markdown on both origins). Cloudflare keys
 * its cache on the URL and documents honouring `Vary` only for Accept-Encoding;
 * nothing in the zone configures otherwise. So the rule admits a request for an
 * HTML document only when it asks for it the way browsers and crawlers do — no
 * RSC headers, no markdown/plain/x-component media type in any Accept value
 * (Accept is list-typed and may arrive as several header lines; the origins
 * honour the combined list, so every value is inspected). Negotiating requests
 * fall through to the bypass and stay DYNAMIC, and nothing is stored that a
 * differently-negotiating client could be handed.
 *
 * Files with a `.md`, `.txt` or `.xml` extension are exempt from that guard: the
 * markdown twins (`/countries/iran.md`, `/docs/documentation.md`), the root agent
 * files, feeds and sitemaps answer the same body for every Accept value and for
 * `RSC: 1` (measured 2026-09-05). Guarding them would push the clients most
 * likely to advertise their media type — agents sending `Accept: text/plain` or
 * `text/markdown` — off the cache these files exist to serve.
 *
 * The homepage has one more representation that no Accept value selects:
 * middleware.ts rewrites `GET /` to /home.md for the User-Agents listed in
 * shared/agent-request-policy.json (`Vary: User-Agent`, `no-store`). The
 * no-store keeps that markdown out of the edge; the problem is the other
 * direction. Cloudflare answers from the stored browser HTML before the
 * middleware runs and ignores Vary: User-Agent, so on a warm edge server a
 * crawler never sees its document. Those requests are carved out of the `/`
 * claim alone: /dashboard and the corpus answer one body whatever the UA, and
 * the AI crawlers are the audience the corpus cache exists to serve.
 *
 * ## Safety of caching these documents at a shared edge
 *
 * The corpus is written at build time by scripts/build-crawlable-corpus.mjs and
 * is byte-identical across audiences — verified on production before this rule
 * landed: `/countries/iran/` returned the same md5 for GPTBot, a browser UA, and
 * a request carrying a session cookie. Vercel already serves these from a shared
 * cache (`x-vercel-cache: HIT` under the public `s-maxage=600`), so a second
 * shared cache in front of it exposes nothing new. Non-2xx responses are
 * excluded because a 404 under a corpus prefix is rendered per-request by
 * middleware.ts, and query-bearing URLs are excluded because they reach a
 * User-Agent-dependent 308 there.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 *   node scripts/cloudflare-cache-rule.mjs --print   # the generated rule, no network
 *   node scripts/cloudflare-cache-rule.mjs --check   # compare against the live zone; exit 1 on drift
 *   node scripts/cloudflare-cache-rule.mjs --apply   # idempotent upsert into the zone
 *
 * `--check` and `--apply` need `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` carrying **Zone > Cache
 * Rules > Edit on worldmonitor.app**. That is NOT the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
 * .github/workflows/deploy-worker.yml uses: that secret is scoped to Workers
 * Scripts:Edit + Workers Routes:Edit (see its header comment) and will fail here.
 * Wiring this into CI means provisioning a separate, cache-rules-scoped token.
 * Locally, `CLOUDFLARE_ALL_ACCESS_TOKEN` is accepted as a fallback because that
 * is what .env.local carries — note it is account-wide, so a mistake here runs
 * with far more Cloudflare authority than the task needs. Set exactly one token;
 * the script refuses to guess when both variables are present.
 *
 * `--apply` touches only this one rule and the rules it has superseded
 * (RETIRED_CACHE_RULES), then re-reads the zone to confirm it actually wins.
 * Cloudflare keeps prior ruleset versions, so a bad apply is also recoverable
 * from the dashboard's ruleset history.
