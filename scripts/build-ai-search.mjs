/**
 * Regenerate the citable figures in public/ai-search.md (#6038).
 *
 * ai-search.md exists so an assistant can lift a fact and attribute it. #6736
 * removed every numeral from `## Data Coverage` because the hand-authored
 * totals had rotted and nothing regenerated them, which traded a wrong number
 * for an uncitable one — meanwhile /sources/ kept publishing exact provider and
 * host counts one click away. This generator restores the figures and takes
 * them from the same registries /sources/ reads, so the two surfaces cannot
 * disagree.
 *
 * The prose stays hand-authored. Only the `## Data Coverage` block and the
 * document's `Last updated:` line are generated; everything else in the file is
 * preserved verbatim.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run build:ai-search
 *   npm run build:ai-search:check
