/**
 * Newest and oldest usable observation in a JODI snapshot, as epoch
 * milliseconds anchored to the END of each record's data month.
 *
 * With China demoted to a diagnostic, this is what keeps a frozen upstream file
 * from publishing as if it were fresh: the seeder feeds it to runSeed's
 * content-age contract, and /api/health reports STALE_CONTENT once the whole
 * dataset falls behind MAX_JODI_CONTENT_AGE_MIN.
 *
 * Only records that carry a real measurement count. A country row that parsed
 * into nothing but nulls proves the download happened, never that the file
 * still holds current observations. Returns null when no record qualifies,
 * which both runSeed and health read as "content age unknown" — STALE_CONTENT,
 * not OK.
 *
 * Months that have not finished yet are skipped for the same reason
 * `assessChinaJodiCoverage` rejects them: an observation cannot be reported
 * before its period ends, so one mis-dated country must not be able to vouch
 * for the freshness of the whole file. For the same reason the newest month
 * must clear `minCountries` — see MIN_JODI_CONTENT_AGE_COUNTRIES.
 *
 * This reduces with max-over-quorum, NOT the min() that
 * `docs/solutions/design-patterns/multi-source-freshness-clock-must-reduce-with-min.md`
 * requires. That rule governs one canonical key fed by several independently
 * failing UPSTREAMS, where the live one hides the dead one. JODI is a single
 * upstream — one file per fuel — whose countries are series inside it, and
 * whose reporting lag is heterogeneous by design: the live files carry a tail
 * back to 2014-03, so min() would report twelve years stale forever and could
 * never go green. Gating the whole file on one country is also the exact
 * defect issue #6395 removes. The quorum is what keeps max() honest here:
 * a file that stops advancing cannot keep three countries moving, so the
 * doc's own diagnostic — "which single upstream can stop publishing without
 * changing newestItemAt?" — answers "none" at the granularity that has an
 * upstream.
