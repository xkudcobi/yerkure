/**
 * Backfill missing locale strings using Claude Haiku as the translator.
 *
 * - Source of truth: src/locales/en.json (or pro-test/src/locales/en.json with --pro-test)
 * - Diffs each non-English locale against EN, sends the missing AND the stale
 *   keys in batches to Claude, deep-merges the response back into the locale file.
 * - Staleness is tracked by an EN baseline snapshot (scripts/locale-baselines/).
 *   A key that is present in a locale but whose English source has changed since
 *   the last completed run is retranslated. Without this, changing English copy
 *   silently rots every translation of it — and inserting one array element
 *   shifts every later index onto the wrong string (issue #5633).
 * - Preserves i18next interpolation tokens (`{{name}}`, `<strong>`, emoji,
 *   numerals, URLs) verbatim — the model is instructed not to translate them.
 * - Idempotent: re-running on a fully-translated, fully-fresh locale is a no-op.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... node scripts/translate-locales.mjs
 *   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... node scripts/translate-locales.mjs --only=fr,de
 *   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... node scripts/translate-locales.mjs --pro-test
 *   node scripts/translate-locales.mjs --dry-run    # just report the gap
 *   ... --adopt-baseline   # FIRST adoption of a root only; records the current
 *                          # translations as correct without checking them
 *
 * Cost: ~8.3K strings × 20 locales backfill ≈ ~$3 on claude-haiku-4-5.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Preserve interpolation tokens EXACTLY as-is: {{count}}, {{name}}, {{tone}}, etc. — do NOT translate or move them.
2. Preserve HTML tags EXACTLY: <strong>, <br>, <em>, <li>, <ul>. Do NOT translate tag names.
3. Preserve emoji, numerals, URLs, and capitalisation style of acronyms (PRO, BREAKING, ALERT, AI, MCP, CII, RSS, ADS-B, AIS).
4. Preserve format (sentence case vs ALL CAPS) — section titles like "BREAKING & CONFIRMED" stay ALL CAPS in the target language too.
5. Output is tab-separated: one line per input, format: <key><TAB><translation>. NOTHING ELSE — no commentary, no quotes, no markdown.
6. Translate naturally for a software UI: concise, idiomatic, no over-formal phrasing.
7. For Arabic, use modern standard Arabic (MSA). For Chinese, follow the target language named above exactly: Simplified characters and Mainland vocabulary for Simplified Chinese, Traditional characters and Taiwan vocabulary for Traditional Chinese (Taiwan). Never convert between the two scripts.
8. i18next plural variants: keys ending in _zero, _one, _two, _few, _many, or _other are CLDR plural forms of the same noun. Inflect the noun's morphology to match the CLDR plural category named by the suffix for the target locale, following the standard CLDR plural rules for that language (which include teen-case exceptions — do NOT use simplified "2-4" / "5+" rules of thumb; follow CLDR exactly). Safe per-suffix semantics that always hold: _one = singular form; _two = dual form (Arabic and a few others); _zero = the zero-count form (Arabic). Keep {{count}} in the translation even when the morphology itself encodes the count (i18next convention).
9. This is an OSINT / geopolitics / markets dashboard. The strings are labels torn out of that context, so the everyday reading of a word is usually the wrong one. Translate these terms in the sense given here:
${DOMAIN_GLOSSARY}
10. Product, brand and dataset names stay untranslated: Product Hunt, Techmeme, Big Mac Index, Smartraveller, GDELT, Polymarket, Hyperliquid, OpenSky, Cloudflare Radar, World Monitor. The same holds for the app's own component names a translation cannot rename: sidecar, widget, panel, dashboard, feed.
