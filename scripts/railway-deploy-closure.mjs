// Which repository changes can actually reach a given Railway service.
//
// One definition, shared by the two sides that must agree (#6142):
//
//   - scripts/trigger-railway-deploys.mjs decides which services a merge has to
//     build, and triggers those builds from CI.
//   - scripts/check-railway-deploy-drift.mjs decides whether a service running
//     an older commit is behind or simply untouched by everything since.
//
// Splitting that judgement across two implementations is how the two surfaces
// drift into disagreeing about the same service, so both import this file.
//
// WHY rootDirectory IS LOAD-BEARING BELOW
//
// #6141 read Railway's `SKIPPED` deployments as refusals of pushes that plainly
// matched the watch-path glob. Re-measured fleet-wide it is not: 57 of the 60
// apparent refusals matched a pattern whose every matched file lay OUTSIDE the
// service's build context. A `nixpacks-root-scripts` service is built with the
// context rooted at scripts/, so scripts/ IS the container — the same
// containment tests/nixpacks-seeder-import-graph.test.mjs enforces on imports —
// and a commit touching only repository-root `shared/` cannot change that image
// however the watch patterns read. A matcher that ignores the build context
// reports those 57 as false rejections.
//
// The full measurement and its methodology live in
// docs/solutions/integration-issues/railway-seeder-watch-paths-can-skip-deployments.md,
// which is the one place they are maintained.
//
// DIRECTION OF FAILURE
//
// Every uncertain case here resolves to "this change affects the service".
// Over-reporting costs a build; under-reporting silently strands a service on
// old code, which is the failure both callers exist to prevent.

// Railway records a refused push as a deployment whose status is SKIPPED, with
// the reason it refused. The two reasons mean opposite things and must not be
// collapsed: this one is the filter working as configured.

// ...while this one is a deferral that has nothing to do with paths. Railway
// evaluates the commit's whole GitHub check suite, so a scheduled workflow that
// re-reports a failure onto main's head SHA after the merge — the freshness
// monitor, the security audit, the storage monitor — turns every service's
