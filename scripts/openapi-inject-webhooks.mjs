/**
 * Inject the outbound webhook-delivery contract into the OpenAPI bundle.
 *
 * The ShippingV2Service lets partners register a `callbackUrl` (RegisterWebhook)
 * that WorldMonitor POSTs a signed chokepoint-disruption alert to. The delivery
 * worker (server/worldmonitor/shipping/v2/deliver-webhook.ts) signs every POST
 * with an HMAC-SHA256 over the raw body, keyed by the subscription `secret`, and
 * sends it in a branded `X-WM-Signature` header (plus `X-WM-Event` /
 * `X-WM-Delivery-Id`). The sebuf `protoc-gen-openapiv3` plugin only emits the
 * *inbound* request/response shapes it can see in the proto; it has no way to
 * describe an *outbound* callback, so the published spec references the HMAC
 * secret (RegisterWebhookResponse.secret) without ever naming the signature
 * header an agent needs to verify a delivery. Agent-readiness scanners
 * (ora.ai / orank) flag this: "Webhook signing referenced ... but no branded
 * signature header identified".
 *
 * OpenAPI 3.1 models exactly this with a top-level `webhooks` object (a map of
 * named Path Item Objects describing requests the API *initiates*). This step
 * injects one `chokepoint.disruption` webhook documenting the three branded
 * headers, the payload schema, and — crucially — the verification recipe, so a
 * consuming agent can confirm a delivery genuinely came from WorldMonitor.
 *
 * Only the bundle (docs/api/worldmonitor.openapi.yaml) is touched: it is copied
 * to public/openapi.yaml and deserialized to public/openapi.json (the artifact
 * orank fetches) at build time. The per-service ShippingV2Service spec is left
 * alone — top-level `webhooks` is a bundle-level, cross-cutting concern and the
 * Mintlify per-service renderer does not surface it.
 *
 * Like the sibling injectors this runs in the `make generate` codegen context
 * (no npm deps guaranteed), so it has no external imports: the block is a static
 * constant and the YAML write is a formatting-preserving surgical insertion.
 * Wired into `make generate` (after the other OpenAPI injectors) and exposed as
 * `npm run gen:openapi:webhooks`. Idempotent and order-independent: re-running,
 * or a fresh regenerate followed by this step, yields byte-identical output.

            summary: Chokepoint disruption alert (outbound, signed)
            description: |-
                WorldMonitor POSTs this event to the \`callbackUrl\` you register via
                RegisterWebhook whenever a subscribed chokepoint's disruption score
                crosses your \`alertThreshold\`. Every delivery is signed so you can
                confirm it genuinely came from WorldMonitor.

                Verification: the \`${SIGNATURE_HEADER}\` header is
                \`sha256=<hex>\`, where \`<hex>\` is the lowercase hex HMAC-SHA256 of the
                exact raw request body, keyed by the \`secret\` returned when you
                registered the webhook. To verify, recompute
                \`sha256=\` + hex(HMAC_SHA256(key=secret, message=rawRequestBody)) over
                the bytes exactly as received (do not re-serialize the JSON) and
                compare against \`${SIGNATURE_HEADER}\` in constant time. Use the
                \`secret\` string verbatim as the HMAC key — do not hex-decode it.
                Reject the delivery if the signatures differ.

                A verifiable signed sample (fixed secret + exact raw body +
                resulting signature) is published at
                https://www.worldmonitor.app/.well-known/webhook-sample.json so you
                can confirm your HMAC verification end-to-end before registering.

                Respond with any 2xx to acknowledge receipt; a non-2xx response or a
                timeout marks the delivery failed. \`${DELIVERY_ID_HEADER}\` uniquely
                identifies each delivery for idempotent processing.
