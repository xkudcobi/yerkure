// Sprint 3a — content-age helpers for seed-climate-news.mjs.
//
// Why a separate module instead of inlining in the seeder:
//
// Tests can't import `seed-climate-news.mjs` directly because its top-level
// runSeed() call exits the process on import. Extracting the pure contentMeta
// here is the same drift-prevention pattern Sprint 2 settled on for
// disease-outbreaks (see `_disease-outbreaks-helpers.mjs` header) — the
// seeder imports this, the test imports this, so a future change can't drift
// silently between the two.
//
// Climate-news is simpler than disease-outbreaks: the seeder already filters
// out items with `publishedAt: 0` at parse time (seed-climate-news.mjs:76 +
// :132), so there is NO synthetic-tagging risk and NO publishTransform
// stripping needed — `item.publishedAt` is always a real, parsed RSS pubDate
// (or its fallback chain: pubDate → published → updated → dc:date).

/**
 * Compute newest/oldest content timestamps from the climate-news payload.
 *
 * - Reads `item.publishedAt` directly (no _originalPublishedMs/_synthetic
 *   helpers because the seeder rejects undated items at parse time).
 * - Excludes future-dated items beyond 1h clock-skew tolerance — matches the
 *   tolerance disease-outbreaks (Sprint 2) and list-feed-digest's
 *   FUTURE_DATE_TOLERANCE_MS use.
 * - Returns null when no items have a usable timestamp — runSeed writes
 *   newestItemAt: null, classifier reads as STALE_CONTENT.
 *
 * @param {{items: Array}} data
 * @param {number} nowMs - injectable "now" for deterministic tests; defaults to Date.now()
