// The heavy half of static-ref (#6806). The three rotated members are
// low-cadence but expensive, and leftover's 570s tick could not hold them
// alongside the light members. The daily Supply-Vulnerability projection
// shares the lead position on alternating ticks with the rotated heavy members.
// Military-Bases and the projection cannot fit at their combined worst case,
// so this two-tick fairness rule is what bounds either member's deferral.
//
// ONE service, not three. Railway kills a cron container at 10 minutes, so the
// budget is 570s and no arrangement can run Arms-Suppliers (380s worst case)
// and Military-Bases (410s) in the SAME tick. But "cannot share a tick" is not
// "cannot share a bundle": the runner defers the loser to the next daily tick,
// and at 14-day and 30-day cadences a one-day deferral costs nothing. Three
// 1-section services would have bought the same isolation at 3x the Railway
// service budget, which is capped at 100 and already at 81.
//
// Heavy ordering ROTATES because a member that never publishes never stops
// being due.
// That is not hypothetical here: Arms-Suppliers has never written
// seed-meta:military:arms-suppliers-complete, so a fixed order would hand it
// the first slot every single day and reproduce, inside this bundle, the exact
// starvation that made it necessary. seed-bundle-macro.mjs uses the same device
// for the same reason (its education member gets first priority one UTC day a
// week). With three members on a daily tick, each one leads every third day —
// far more often than any of these cadences needs, so a permanently failing
// member can consume at most one heavy lead slot in three. The daily projection
// leads every other tick, so a permanently due Military-Bases run cannot starve
// it past the two-day health budget (and the inverse cannot happen either).

  // Cheapest first in the canonical order. On the two days it does not lead it

  // (335+190=525s), against a 570s budget.
  //
  // This did NOT hold before the sweep. Arms-Suppliers ran 390.9s on 2026-08-18,
  // leaving 179s against this section's 190s reservation, and the log read
  // "needs 190s but only 178s left" — Mineral-Production deferred by ELEVEN
  // seconds on the tick its acknowledgement expired.

  // deadline + publish), not the whole ~200-importer catalog, so it no longer
  // needs a 450s reservation and no longer starves the members behind it. The
