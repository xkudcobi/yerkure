/**
 * Capacity report for the unified public/openapi.json (#6558).
 *
 * The artifact is a recurring capacity risk for agent-readiness scanners: they
 * cap spec bodies around 1 MB, and ora.ai/orank's function-calling check
 * degrades from a computed verdict to "couldn't validate" above it (#4852).
 * `tests/openapi-json-dedup.test.mjs` guards the ceiling, but a guard only
 * speaks the moment it breaks — it reports nothing on the way there, so the
 * last three crossings were each discovered by a red build on the PR that
 * happened to be last in line (#4852, #6440's food-stocks operation, the
 * billing-verification 503 that landed 497 bytes over).
 *
 * This reports the number the guard is silent about: how many bytes the served
 * artifact actually spends, how many are left, and — when the answer is "not
 * many" — which repeated or generated structures are worth collapsing next.
 *
 * Measurement contract:
 *   - Bytes come from `buildBundle()` in build-openapi-json.mjs, the same call
 *     that writes the artifact. A re-implementation here could drift from what
 *     is served; an import cannot.
 *   - Bytes are UTF-8 bytes, not `String#length`. The cap is a body-size cap in
 *     bytes and the descriptions carry non-ASCII punctuation, so the two
 *     numbers differ (264 bytes apart on the 2026-08-13 bundle) and only one of
 *     them is what a scanner fetches.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/openapi-capacity-report.mjs               # human summary
 *   node scripts/openapi-capacity-report.mjs --json        # report to stdout
 *   node scripts/openapi-capacity-report.mjs --out cap.json
 *
 * Exit codes (every non-pass is nonzero):
 *   0  measured; artifact within budget (a breached reserve warns, see below)
 *   1  artifact is OVER budget
 *   2  the tool was misused (bad args, unwritable --out)
 *   3  the bundle could not be measured (no operations, no bytes)
 *
 * A breached reserve exits 0 on purpose. The ceiling already has a gate; a
 * second hard failure at the same wall would just be the same red build one
 * commit earlier. The reserve is an advisory number that makes the trend
 * legible while there is still room to act on it.
