    whyHeading: 'Why is Dover among the busiest lanes if World Monitor maps no corridor row?',
    blurb:
      'The Strait of Dover is the narrowest point of the English Channel, connecting it to the North Sea. It is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, funnelling North Sea and Baltic traffic past the coasts of England and France.',
    analysis: [
      'Dover is a TSS-controlled bottleneck between the North Sea and the Atlantic approaches, not a canal. Ferry, short-sea, and deep-sea north–south European traffic share a narrow, tidal lane. World Monitor tracks it as a strategic waterway reference: it is not currently mapped to one of the modelled trade-route corridors, but vessel traffic and disruption signals are still monitored on the live map.',
      'The EIA 2023 series does not publish a “Dover” row. World Monitor’s energy-flow seeder maps this registry id to the Danish Straits baseline of 3.0 million barrels a day — the broader Baltic–North Sea passage set, not a Dover-only meter. Shock modelling is off. Readers should not treat 3.0 million barrels a day as a Dover throughput claim.',
    ],
    alternative:
      'Deep-sea ships can in principle use the longer Scotland–Norway gap, but that is not how the North Sea–Atlantic container and energy pattern is scheduled. The Channel is the short road; Dover is where it pinches.',

        question: 'Does World Monitor publish modelled TEU or bpd through Dover?',

    whyHeading: 'Why does control of the Kerch Strait gate Azov-basin trade?',
    blurb:
      'The Kerch Strait connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov and is the only sea route to the Azov ports of Ukraine and Russia. It has been a repeated flashpoint in the Russia–Ukraine conflict, where control of the strait directly gates Azov-basin trade.',
    analysis: [
      'Kerch is a shallow, bridged strait. Since the Kerch Bridge opened, air draft and security screening sit on top of the geographic cork. Mariupol, Berdyansk, and the Russian Azov ports are Azov-basin ports; they do not have a second sea mouth. A blocked or heavily inspected Kerch Strait is therefore a port shutdown for that basin, not a Cape-style detour.',
      'World Monitor maps no TRADE_ROUTES waypoint here. The modelled Russia → Mediterranean oil corridor uses the Bosporus from Novorossiysk, a Black Sea port west of Kerch, so that row does not speak for Azov. There is no EIA oil-transit baseline and no energy shock model. This page exists because the registry treats Kerch as a conflict-sensitive waterway, not because a TEU corridor has been encoded.',
    ],
    alternative:
      'There is no maritime alternative into the Sea of Azov. Overland and river options (Don, rail) move some bulk but do not recreate an Azov seaport call. That is closer to Bosporus-style isolation than to Suez-style extra days.',

    blurb:
      'The Lombok Strait, between Bali and Lombok, is a deep-water alternative to the Malacca–Singapore route. It is favoured by the largest, deepest-draft bulk carriers and serves as a relief valve when Malacca is congested or disrupted.',
    analysis: [
      'Lombok is deep and relatively uncluttered compared with Malacca–Singapore. Very large crude and ore carriers that cannot take Malacca’s draft come this way (often with Makassar) between the Indian Ocean and East Asian discharge ranges. World Monitor therefore lists it next to Malacca even though no TRADE_ROUTES waypoint currently points here: it is the documented overflow, not a second copy of the 17.2 million-barrel Malacca baseline.',
      'There is no EIA oil-transit baseline on Lombok itself and no energy shock model. The energy shock stays on Malacca. An empty modelled table means the corridor book has not yet encoded Lombok legs; it does not mean VLCC captains stopped using the strait.',
