// How long has anything actually reconciled the Railway fleet? (#6203)
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// During the bounded rollback window,
// .github/workflows/railway-deploy-trigger.yml has two outcomes that are
// indistinguishable at the workflow-status level:
//
//   - it read main's head, found the gate green, and deployed every service
//     that was behind; and
//   - it read main's head, found the gate not-yet-green, skipped every step
//     that does work, and concluded `success`.
//
// Measured on 2026-08-05: over 2h03m the workflow produced ONE scheduled run,
// and that run took the second branch. Meanwhile 10 services sat on b7f2054df
// for ~19.5h. Nothing anywhere went red.
//
// The workflow's existing escalation asks "how long has main's gate been
// pending", which only fires ON A RUN — the precondition that failed. This
// asks the question that does not depend on why: when did a run last actually
// reconcile? The answer comes from the workflow's own run history, because a
// run that reconciled and a run that declined differ only in whether the
// strict terminal acceptance STEP ran.
//
// DIRECTION OF FAILURE
//
// Every case where the record is missing, unreadable, ambiguous or truncated
// resolves away from "healthy". A scanner whose unmatched case means HEALTHY
// is the same defect in a new place.

// The step whose conclusion IS the signal. A run reconciled iff this step ran
// and succeeded; `skipped` is the #6203 transcript verbatim.
//

// because a rename here would make every run read as "did not reconcile" —
// which alarms rather than going quiet, but alarms forever for the wrong
// reason.
