 * Why this exists: on 2026-07-20 the collector's Node process OOM-died and
 * Railway neither restarted it nor flipped the deployment off `SUCCESS`, so
 * nothing alerted. Every product-analytics event was dropped for 4 days
 * (~1.1M events) and the gap was only found by hand while asking an unrelated
 * question about a funnel. See #5565.
 *
 * Deliberately probes the collector directly rather than trusting Railway's
 * deployment status, which was green throughout that outage.
