# Green-tree attestation primitives for .husky/pre-push (#5800).
#
# The hook's cache records `HEAD^{tree}` and, on a later push of that same tree,
# skips every tree-dependent gate. That makes each of these a "bad run that
# suppresses future runs" rather than "one bad run", so the decisions below are
# the sharp edge of the whole gate:
#
#   * WHICH paths changed         — read NUL-delimited, so `core.quotePath`
#                                   C-quoting (unicode, backslash, newline)
#                                   cannot rename a path into one that no
#                                   longer exists and gets silently skipped.
#   * WHICH of those exist in HEAD — asked of git (`--diff-filter=d`), never
#                                   inferred from `[ -f ]` against a worktree
#                                   that may have drifted from HEAD.
#   * WHETHER the run attests HEAD — the gates execute the WORKTREE; the cache
#                                   claims HEAD. Those are the same bytes only
#                                   when the tracked tree is clean.
#
# They live here, in modes a test can execute against real git fixtures
# (tests/prepush-attest.test.mjs), instead of inline in the hook where only a
# grep over its source text could guard them — and a source grep stays green
# when `true` is flipped to `false`.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/prepush-attest.sh changed      <base-ref>   # NUL list
#   bash scripts/prepush-attest.sh changed-live <base-ref>   # NUL list, minus deletions
#   bash scripts/prepush-attest.sh drift        <base-ref>   # NUL list of offenders
#   bash scripts/prepush-attest.sh dirty                     # NUL list of offenders
#   bash scripts/prepush-attest.sh cache-read   <file> <tree> <diff-resolved>
#   bash scripts/prepush-attest.sh cache-write  <file> <tree> <diff-resolved> <attestable>
#   bash scripts/prepush-attest.sh base-guard   <base-ref> [limit]  # "<base>\t<count>" on stdout
#   bash scripts/prepush-attest.sh gate-read    <cache-dir> <gate> <diff-resolved> -- <pathspec>...
#   bash scripts/prepush-attest.sh gate-write   <cache-dir> <gate> <diff-resolved> <attestable> -- <pathspec>...
#   bash scripts/prepush-attest.sh worktree-diff [<root>] -- <pathspec>...
#
# Exit codes are three-valued on purpose. A gate that answers "no" and a gate
# that could not run must never collapse into the same status as "yes":
#
#   0  yes / clean / hit / written
#   3  no  / drift / dirty / miss / refused   (the list, or the reason, on stdout)
#   2  usage error
#   1  internal failure (git unavailable, unwritable cache, ...)
#
# worktree-diff maps `git diff --exit-code` onto that same scale so a freshness
# gate can tell 0 (clean) from 1 (real diff → 3) from 128 (could not run → 1).
# `if ! git diff --exit-code` collapses the last two (#7445).
