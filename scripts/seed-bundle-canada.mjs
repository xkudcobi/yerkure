// Canada ingest bundle.
//
// WHY A BUNDLE, NOT TEN SERVICES: the Canada pack (#6604-#6659) introduced
// seeders. Provisioned individually they would consume a Railway slot each against
// a fleet whose own runbook targets 65 services, for a combined measured tick
// cost of ~33s — 6% of this runner's 570s admission budget. #6670 already made
// the same call for BoC/StatCan by joining seed-bundle-macro rather than adding
// services. seed-bundle-regional is NOT the right home: it orchestrates LLM
// briefs and snapshots, a different domain from raw ingest crons.
//
// WHY THE CRON IS */5 WITH PER-MEMBER intervalMs: the runner gates each section
// on its own `intervalMs` against that section's seed-meta age, so a single
// service hosts members at different effective cadences. TTC and Toronto Fire
// CAD need 5 minutes; nothing else does. The remaining members declare the cadence their upstream
// actually justifies rather than inheriting TTC's.
//
// CADENCES ARE DELIBERATE, NOT INHERITED. Measured payloads per tick (live,
// 2026-08-14): Toronto 3.62MB, Ontario+Alberta 1.99MB, BC 0.87MB, VIA 0.30MB,
// TTC 27KB, Alberta alerts 12KB. Polling Toronto's construction-permit feed
// every 15 minutes cost 348 MB/day for data that changes on a permit desk's
// schedule; at 2h it costs ~44 MB/day. BC at 30min halves 84 MB/day. Together
// with the unchanged members that is ~938 -> ~394 MB/day.
//
// FAILURE SEMANTICS: every member runs through `runSeed`, whose fetch-phase
// catch preserves last-good and exits GRACEFUL_FETCH_FAILURE_EXIT_CODE (75).
// The runner counts 75 as a graceful skip and still exits 0, so an upstream
// flake — the realistic failure for all six — cannot red this service. What DOES
// red it is a hard non-zero exit or a SIGTERM timeout, which is why each member's
// timeoutMs is sized above its measured worst case rather than its median.

  // TPS Open Data (#7012/#7036) — the retrospective MCI and annual Calls

  // WHY THEY JOINED THE BUNDLE: "on-demand" had no invoker. Nothing scheduled
  // scripts/seed-tps-open-data.mjs and no request path gap-fills it, so the 24h
  // canonical TTL emptied both keys a day after each hand run while seed-meta
  // (5.9d TTL) still reported `ok`. Observed live 2026-09-04: both canonical
  // keys absent, both seed-metas ok.
  //
  // WHY THE CAPACITY OBJECTION NO LONGER APPLIES: the adapter header rules this
  // out on the cost of a full 486k-row MCI walk (~243 pages), which the adapter
  // never performs — it is a bounded worker (90-day lookback, maxPages 3,
  // 2,000-row page cap). Measured live 2026-09-04: MCI 3,195 records in 7.9s,
  // Calls 5,982 in 7.1s, 22.1s for the pair — ~4% of this runner's 570s budget,
  // against the ~33s this bundle already accepts for the rest of the pack.
  //
  // WHY 6h AND NOT 5min: MCI is retrospective and Calls is an annual aggregate
  // (upstream edit dates are months apart), so cadence here keeps OUR copy warm
  // rather than chasing upstream. Four runs a day hold 4x margin against the
  // 24h TTL, so the canonical key never lapses between ticks.
