/**
 * Seeder-side helper for the historical intelligence memory (#5694).
 *
 * Seeders call `appendSeedHistory` from their `afterPublish` hook to
 * embed a run's noteworthy records and append them to the Convex
 * intel-history store via the authenticated `/relay/intel-history`
 * HTTP action.
 *
 * FAIL-OPEN BY DESIGN. History is a secondary artefact of a seed run —
 * a history failure must never fail the run. Two layers enforce that:
 *
 *   1. Missing configuration is NOT an error. Any of CONVEX_SITE_URL
 *      (or CONVEX_URL), RELAY_SHARED_SECRET, OPENROUTER_API_KEY absent
 *      → one warn, `{ skipped: 'unconfigured' }`, zero network calls.
 *      Local runs and un-provisioned Railway services stay silent-ish.
 *   2. Hard runtime failures (embedder outage, relay 5xx after retries)
 *      throw a SeedHistoryError. Callers MUST wrap the call in
 *      try/catch — this module deliberately does not swallow real
 *      failures, so the seeder decides whether to log or ignore.
 *
 * Because of (1) and (2) the log stream was, until #5736, the ONLY place a
 * broken history pipeline showed up: a missing RELAY_SHARED_SECRET or a
 * systematically rejecting relay produced a healthy-looking seed run forever
 * while the store received nothing. `recordHistoryIngestHealth` closes that
 * hole by persisting a durable per-(domain, resource) ingest-health record on
 * BOTH the success and the failure path, separate from the seeder's own
 * seed-meta (which must keep reflecting canonical publication only).
 *
 * Boundary rules: `scripts/**` ships to Railway via nixpacks with
 * `root_dir=scripts`, so this file may only import from within
 * `scripts/`, `node:*`, and bare packages in scripts/package.json.
 * See tests/scripts-railway-nixpacks-no-escape-import.test.mts.
