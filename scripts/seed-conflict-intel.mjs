/**
 * Build the HAPI coverage marker and the seed-meta diagnostics for one run.
 *
 * Extracted from fetchAll ONLY so it is reachable by a test that can actually
 * fail: the write itself lives behind Redis and a 5-way Promise.allSettled, so
 * asserting on a hand-built argument object proved nothing about what the
 * seeder constructs. Dropping the channel from the marker used to keep the
 * whole suite green.
 *
 * #7658: `sourceChannel` names which of HAPI's two channels served this tick,
 * recorded on BOTH the marker and the seed-meta record. The channels disagree
 * by ~23% on the trailing reference period, so a published number that cannot
 * name its channel cannot be compared with the tick before it. A RUN is
 * single-channel by construction — the channel latches once, before the first
 * sweep — so this names the channel behind every country the caller writes.
 *
 * Scope caveat, because the distinction is load-bearing: the per-country keys
 * outlive a run (HAPI_TTL is 6h, ~3 refresh cycles), and the caller's loop
 * overwrites only the countries THIS run covered. So after a partial run that
 * changed channel, the FAMILY can hold both vintages — the countries this run
 * wrote, plus older ones the previous channel wrote. The marker says which is
 * which: `sourceChannel` describes the whole family exactly when
 * countriesCovered === countriesTotal. Note that is the FULL HAPI_COUNTRIES set
 * (44), not the required set (41) — the 3 opportunistic countries are reachable
 * through getHumanitarianSummary like any other, so a run covering every
 * REQUIRED country can still leave them on the other channel. Making the family
 * atomically single-vintage would mean publishing all 44 as one generation
 * behind a pointer swap — a bigger change to the write path than this fix; the
 * coverage fields make the current state readable, not silent.
 *
 * `sourceState: 'degraded'` is the hook api/health.js already has for "degraded
 * BUT SERVING" (readSeedMeta -> sourceDegraded -> SEED_ERROR at warn, record
 * count preserved). Without it this change would REDUCE observability: a
 * snapshot failure used to be terminal and surfaced as SEED_ERROR, whereas a
 * demotion succeeds, so a permanent HDX-side break (resource rename, 403) would
 * otherwise publish the lagging channel indefinitely with health fully green.
 * Set only when demoted — omitting the field is the no-degradation-claim
 * default, and 'blocked' is deliberately NOT used: api/health.js escalates it
 * to a hard SEED_ERROR for every key but one allowlisted adapter.
