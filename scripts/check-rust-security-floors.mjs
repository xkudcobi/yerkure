/**
 * Rust dependency security floors (#5518, part of #5902).
 *
 * `src-tauri/Cargo.lock` is what actually decides which crate versions ship —
 * the manifest constraint only bounds resolution. Nothing else in CI inspects
 * it: the security-audit workflow covers npm lockfiles only, so before this
 * check a `cargo update` (or a loosened constraint) could silently drop the
 * desktop app back onto a version with a known advisory and no gate would
 * notice. That is the desktop-drift class #5902 exists to close.
 *
 * Each floor is a recorded decision: crate, minimum patched version, and the
 * advisory that set it. A crate named here but ABSENT from the lockfile fails
 * the check rather than passing vacuously — a rename or removal must be an
 * explicit decision to drop the floor, not a silent green.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/check-rust-security-floors.mjs  (npm run desktop:check-rust-floors)
