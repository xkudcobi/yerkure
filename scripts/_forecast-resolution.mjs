// Pure spec-builder module for the forecast resolvability contract (#4976 Bet 1).
//
// Every published forecast gets a machine-checkable ResolutionSpec: `hard`
// (auto-resolvable from a WorldMonitor feed the detector already scored from)
// or `judged` (a resolution question for a later LLM judge, Bet 2). This
// module owns that dispatch, the feed allowlist a hard spec's `sourceFeed`
// must belong to (R4), and the deadline math (R5).
//
// No console output in normal operation. No Date.now() anywhere — every
// timestamp is threaded in as `generatedAt` so output is deterministic and
// testable (same inputs -> identical spec across calls).
//
// metricKey format: '<feedKey>|<fn>(<field>==<value>)' — a path expression
// over the shape read from that feed, with REAL substituted values (region,
// title, ticker) and a unified '==' comparison grammar across every family,
// e.g. 'conflict:acled-resolution:v1:all:0:0|count(country==Mali)' or
// 'market:commodities-bootstrap:v1|price(symbol==CL=F)'. It documents where in
// the feed the metric lives and what to match; it is not executable code and
// is not parsed by this module or any consumer today (Bet 2's resolver
// interprets it). The grammar is frozen into 45-day history, so it must be
// consistent — no literal '<region>'/'<title>' placeholders, no '=' vs '=='
// drift between families. count() means NEW events dated within the spec's
// 'within-horizon' window ([emission, deadline]), with a horizon-scoped
// threshold (#5010) — never the feed's full 365-day trailing tally.

//  1. state_derived origin -> ALWAYS judged, before any family lookup.
//     buildStateDerivedForecast attaches a 'market_transmission' signal
//     (weight 0.24) to every state-derived forecast, so a family-first
//     dispatch would misclassify all of them as hard/market.
//  2. prediction_market family -> hard, BEFORE the JUDGED_DOMAINS gate. A
//     detectFromPredictionMarkets forecast's CLAIM *is* the market question
//     (seed-forecasts.mjs :2228-2242), so the market's own resolution is the
//     claim's ground truth regardless of the domain the detector assigned
//     (which can be political/conflict/market). This is unlike a 'cii' signal
//     on a political claim (evidence, not the claim) — hence the exemption.
//  3. JUDGED_DOMAINS (currently infrastructure and military) -> ALWAYS judged
//     until the forecast carries the stable, claim-aligned metric identity
//     needed for a hard feed lookup.
//  4. Other hard families resolved from pred.signals[].type via
//     SIGNAL_TO_HARD_FAMILY (with the market-domain chokepoint/ais_gap
//     exclusion + a calibration.marketPrice fallback for market-domain
//     forecasts with no direct market-signal match).
//  5. If a hard family is found but yields no finite threshold (or, for
//     'crosses', no finite baselineValue, or an unmapped sourceFeed) -> judged.
//  6. Otherwise (no-signal-match/unrecognized domain) -> judged.
// deriveDeadline is the only call that can throw (an unrecognized horizon);
// buildResolutionSpec itself never throws.
