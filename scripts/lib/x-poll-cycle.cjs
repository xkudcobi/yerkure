// scripts/ais-relay.cjs so it can be EXECUTED by tests. The relay entrypoint is
// 13k lines with no module.exports and no require.main guard, so importing it
// boots the whole relay — which meant this glue could only ever be asserted
// against as source text. Three defects (a generation-field collision, a lease
// handoff that dropped a peer replica's posts, and a stuck-abort threshold that
// outlived the Redis lease) all lived here and all were invisible to a regex.
// Everything the cycle reaches for is injected, so a test can drive the Redis
// lease, hydration and publish paths directly.
