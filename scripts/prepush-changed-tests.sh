# Decide which runner owns each changed test file in a push, and run them (#5795).
#
# The repo has two test runners and they are not interchangeable:
#
#   tests/dom/**   vitest + happy-dom (vitest.dom.config.mts, `npm run test:dom`).
#                  These files import `vitest` and reach components that use
#                  `import.meta.glob`, neither of which tsx/node:test can
#                  resolve — feeding one to `tsx --test` fails inside the
#                  runner and reads as "your DOM test is broken".
#   tests/*        node:test via `tsx --test` (`npm run test:data`).
#
# .husky/pre-push used to sweep both into `tsx --test`, making the gate
# unpassable for every DOM-test change. Keeping the split here — one place,
# executed by tests/prepush-changed-tests.test.mjs — means the hook can't drift
# back into a single glob, and neither can a file end up in NO runner (a silent
# coverage gap is the failure mode that replaces the loud one).
#
# The `run-*` modes exist for the same reason: while the hook held the
# "is this list non-empty, and which runner do I invoke" decision inline, that
# decision could only be guarded by grepping the hook's source text — and a
# source grep stays green when `-n` is flipped to `-z` or `|| exit 1` is
# dropped. Here it is a behavior a test can execute against stubbed runners.
#
# Usage (every list is NUL-delimited, in and out):
#   printf '%s\0' "${CHANGED_LIVE[@]}"     | bash scripts/prepush-changed-tests.sh node
#   printf '%s\0' "${CHANGED_LIVE[@]}"     | bash scripts/prepush-changed-tests.sh dom
#   printf '%s\0' "${TESTS_CHANGED[@]}"    | bash scripts/prepush-changed-tests.sh run-node
#   printf '%s\0' "${DOM_TESTS_CHANGED[@]}"| bash scripts/prepush-changed-tests.sh run-dom
#
# NUL rather than newlines because `git diff --name-only` C-quotes unicode,
# backslash and newline paths under git's default core.quotePath — a line
# reader then holds `"tests/caf\303\251.test.mjs"`, which names no file, and the
# gate sails past a changed test having run nothing (#5800). The hook reads the
# diff with `-z` (scripts/prepush-attest.sh) and the list stays raw bytes from
# there to `tsx --test`.
#
# The two partition modes write the subset of stdin owned by that runner to
# stdout. Deletion filtering is NOT done here: the caller supplies the paths
# that exist in the pushed commit (`prepush-attest.sh changed-live`), because
# `[ -f ]` cannot tell "the push deleted it" from "the worktree drifted from
# what is being pushed" — and inferring the first while it was the second is
# how a changed test silently stopped running. A test path that is missing on
# disk is therefore a broken invariant, and fails loudly.
#
# The two run modes read that runner's final file list and exit non-zero when
# the runner fails. An empty list is a no-op, not a failure.
