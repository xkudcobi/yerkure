// Raw localStorage guard (#7833)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Android WebView with DOM storage disabled exposes `window.localStorage` as
// NULL rather than throwing, so an unguarded `localStorage.getItem(…)` is a
// TypeError, not a catchable SecurityError. That shape has produced three
// separate Sentry issues (WORLDMONITOR-122, -11X, -XG). `-11X` was resolved in
// Sentry on 2026-09-04 with no code change, which is why it came back.
//
// Nothing mechanical stood between those crashes and a green CI: `biome.json`
// has no matching rule, the repo has no eslint config, and none of the other
// `enforce-*.mjs` checks look at storage. Every guard was a hand-rolled
// convention — and conventions are exactly what produced the two call sites
// that LOOK guarded and are not:
//
//   - `cloud-prefs-sync.applyCloudBlob` wrapped its writes in
//     `try { … } finally { … }`. A `finally` catches nothing.
//   - `persistent-cache.deleteFromLocalStorageByPrefix` opened with
//     `typeof localStorage === 'undefined'`, and `typeof null` is `'object'`.
//
// Both are fixed; this guard is what stops the class from coming back a fourth
// time. It runs as a `lint:*` script rather than a test because the edit it
// must catch is "someone touched a service or a panel", which touches nothing
// under tests/ — and `scripts/prepush-changed-tests.sh` only runs a test file
// when that test file is itself in the changed set, so a test-only guard would
// first surface in CI with the PR already open.
//
// WHAT IS BANNED: a DEREFERENCE of `localStorage` outside the sanctioned
// helper. Dereferencing is what throws, so that is what the guard measures. A
// bare mention of the identifier is deliberately legal — `this === localStorage`
// inside the cloud-prefs setItem patch is an identity comparison that cannot
// throw on a null, and `vi.stubGlobal('localStorage', null)` is a string.
//
// Matching is done on the TypeScript AST. It began as regex, and review found
// a fresh bypass in three consecutive rounds — whitespace around the
// identifier's accessor, then around the RECEIVER's accessor, then
// `localStorage!.getItem(k)` (valid TS; `biome.json` leaves noNonNullAssertion
// off). Each round the patterns were widened and the class declared closed;
// each time the next round found another token. Enumerating TypeScript's
// receiver syntax by hand is the whack-a-mole, and the parser already does it
// exactly — so the parser does it. Switching also found three REAL
// dereferences the regex never saw, all `(localStorage as unknown as {…})`
// casts in `followed-only-chip.ts`.
//
// Note what a green run does and does not mean. It means "no NEW dereference
// outside `safe-storage.ts`, and the recorded legacy population still matches
// the tree". It does NOT mean storage access is safe everywhere. Known gaps:
//
//   - a local alias (`const ls = globalThis.localStorage; ls.getItem(k)`) or a
//     destructure (`const { getItem } = localStorage`). These need the type
//     CHECKER, not the parser — an AST alone cannot resolve what `ls` is — so
//     they are the one class this gate structurally cannot close;
//   - a `sessionStorage` deref, which has the identical null shape;
//   - a count-NEUTRAL swap inside an already-inventoried file: deleting one
//     dereference and adding another keeps N the same and passes green.
//
// Add a shape to DEREF_PROBES when a new one appears rather than reading
// silence as proof.

/**
 * Every syntactic shape that reaches THROUGH `localStorage` to something that
 * can throw when the store is null or its property getter throws.
 *
 * These are matched on the TypeScript AST, not on source text. Three rounds of
 * review found three separate token classes a regex missed — whitespace around
 * the identifier's accessor, whitespace around the RECEIVER's accessor, and
 * the non-null assertion in `localStorage!.getItem(k)` (which `biome.json`
 * permits, since `noNonNullAssertion` is off). Each round I patched the token
 * and claimed the class was closed; each time the next round found another.
 * Hand-enumerating TypeScript's receiver syntax is the whack-a-mole, and the
 * parser already does it exactly.
 *
 * The AST also removes this gate's dependence on comment stripping — a comment
 * simply is not a node — which retires the blindness class that made the old
 * regex scanner miss 1826 lines of `panel-layout.ts`.
 *
 * `probes` are the fixtures the self-test matches, so a matcher that silently
 * stops recognizing a shape fails loudly instead of going quiet. Optional
 * chaining (`localStorage?.getItem`) is deliberately still counted: it survives
 * the NULL shape but does nothing for the THROWING one, so on its own it is a
 * half-guard. `safe-storage.ts` pairs it with a try/catch, which is why that
 * file — and only that file — is exempt.
 *
 * NOT closed by this, and not closable without type resolution: a local alias
 * (`const ls = localStorage; ls.getItem(k)`) or a destructure. Those need the
 * checker, not the parser. They stay named in the header as known gaps.

/**
 * Every `<file> :: <idiom> xN` triple outside the helper, as of #7833.
 *
 * Recorded with an OCCURRENCE COUNT, not a per-file or per-(file, idiom)
 * boolean, for the reason `enforce-panel-content-writes.mjs` learned the hard
 * way: a boolean cannot see a SECOND deref of an idiom the file already
 * carries, so a fresh `localStorage.getItem` in `App.ts` — which already has
 * dozens — would pass green. That is the highest-traffic regression shape
 * there is, because new code lands in the files that already read storage.
 * With counts, a new deref bumps N and fails `unlisted`; a migration lowers N
 * and fails `stale`.
 *
 * This list is a ratchet, not a permission slip:
 *   - a NEW pair, or a HIGHER count, fails the guard — route the access
 *     through `@/utils/safe-storage` instead;
 *   - a pair that shrank or vanished MUST be updated here, so the inventory
 *     can never quietly outlive the drift it records.
 *
 * Counts come from the AST, so a comment mentioning an idiom is simply not a
 * node — documenting the rule neither inflates an entry nor keeps a migrated
 * one alive.
 *
 * An entry here is NOT automatically a bug. Three populations are mixed in,
 * and the CLI cannot tell them apart — read the call site before "fixing" one:
 *
 *   1. Genuinely unguarded, and reachable. These are the #7833 backlog. Boot
 *      path first.
 *   2. Guarded by a surrounding try/catch or a capability probe that really
 *      does fire. `src/App.ts` is the large one: its constructor probes with a
 *      write/remove inside a try and drops to `storageAvailable = false`, and
 *      every migration below it sits behind that flag. Its entry exists to
 *      catch a NEW deref landing OUTSIDE the probe, not because the cascade
 *      is broken.
 *   3. Deliberately raw, because the helper's contract is wrong for the site.
 *      `persistent-cache` needs the QuotaExceededError to distinguish a full
 *      disk (`markStorageQuotaExceeded`) from an unusable store, and
 *      `settings-persistence.importSettings` must fail LOUDLY rather than
 *      report "0 keys imported" as success. These are terminal states, not
 *      unfinished migrations.
 *
 * The CLI derives and reports the entry and call-site totals from this
 * registry; do not duplicate those shrinking counts in this comment.
