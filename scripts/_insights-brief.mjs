Rules:
- "lead": 2-3 sentences, under 80 words, synthesizing the most consequential 2-3 threads. Cite every claim with the bracket number of its story, e.g. [1] or [3].
- "lines": exactly one entry per numbered story, in order. Each "text" is ONE sentence under 30 words restating that story, ending with its citation [n].
- Use ONLY facts present in the numbered story text. Do not add names, places, dates, numbers, or context that are not explicitly there.
- Do not invent proper nouns (people, organizations, countries) that are not in the story text.
- Two numbered stories can describe the SAME event in different words. A lead claim may combine them, but it MUST carry the citation of EVERY story it drew from — write [3][7], not just [3]. Any name, place, or number you take from a story you did not cite counts as invented.
- If you name an outlet, copy its label exactly (including capitalization) and use it only as an attribution: "<outlet> reported/reports/said/says/wrote/writes ..." or "According to <outlet>, ...".
- Write acronyms WITHOUT periods: "US", "UN", "EU", "UK" — never "U.S.", "U.N.". A trailing period there reads as the end of a sentence.
- Refer to an actor by the name the story uses. Do not swap in a capital city, nickname, or synonym for it — write "US", not "Washington"; "Iran", not "Tehran" — unless that word is in the story text.
- NEVER start with "Breaking news", "Good evening", "Tonight", or TV-style openings.`;
