# Per-seeder wall-clock cap for STANDALONE seeders. They run sequentially, so a
# single upstream that hangs (e.g. a slow NOAA/NSIDC fetch that doesn't honour its
# own AbortSignal and keeps the node process alive for an hour) would burn the rest
# of the window and starve every later seeder — under a wrapping systemd/cron job
# timeout it drops everything after the hung one. Capping each seeder bounds that
# blast radius. Default 1800s (30min): above any standalone seeder's real runtime
# yet below the pathological hangs (60min+), so it kills only runaway runs.
# Override with SEED_TIMEOUT=<seconds>, or SEED_TIMEOUT=0 to disable.
#
# Bundle seeders (seed-bundle-*.mjs) are EXEMPT from this cap: scripts/_bundle-runner.mjs
# already hard-caps every section with its own wall-clock timer (SIGTERM→SIGKILL on
# the section's child PID — immune to the DNS-hang blind spot) and runs sections
# sequentially, so a bundle's *legitimate* total can exceed SEED_TIMEOUT (e.g.
# resilience-recovery's Import-HHI section alone budgets 30min). Wrapping a bundle in
# the outer cap would false-kill it mid-run and orphan the in-flight section child.
