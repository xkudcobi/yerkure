/**
 * GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server (rewritten to /api/oauth-authorization-server)
 *
 * RFC 8414 OAuth Authorization Server Metadata, served dynamically so every
 * host that terminates the request (apex worldmonitor.app, www, or
 * api.worldmonitor.app) returns self-consistent metadata whose `issuer` and
 * endpoints point back at the request origin.
 *
 * Why dynamic (was a static file at public/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server):
 * the RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata (api/oauth-protected-resource.ts) is
 * already host-derived, so its `authorization_servers[*]` equals the request
 * origin. RFC 8414 requires `issuer` to equal the origin the document is served
 * from, and agent-readiness scanners (ora.ai/orank) cross-check that the PRM
 * `authorization_servers` entry resolves to an AS document whose `issuer`
 * matches. A single static file with a hardcoded `issuer` can only satisfy one
 * origin; deriving `issuer` + every endpoint from the Host header keeps PRM and
 * AS metadata aligned on whichever host is scanned, while the same-origin
 * construction also satisfies isitagentready.com / mcp.cloudflare.com.
 *
 * The `agent_auth` block follows the WorkOS auth.md spec
 * (https://workos.com/auth-md). WorldMonitor supports anonymous agent
 * registration: an agent registers a public client via RFC 7591 Dynamic Client
 * Registration (`register_uri`) and completes an OAuth 2.1 authorization_code +
 * PKCE (S256) flow to obtain a bearer access token — no pre-asserted user
 * identity (identity is established interactively during authorization). WM does
 * not implement ID-JAG identity assertion endpoints, so only `anonymous` is
 * advertised. The `skill` field round-trips to the published /auth.md.
 *
 * `claim_uri` completes the anonymous method: an anonymously-registered agent's
 * credential is *claimed* (bound to a human owner) at authorization time — the
 * interactive `/oauth/authorize` consent ties the issued token to whoever signs
 * in. WM has no standalone claim endpoint, so the claim URI is the authorization
 * endpoint (the actual claim ceremony). Agent-readiness scanners (isitagentready
 * / ora.ai) require a `claim_uri` for the anonymous registration method; we
 * advertise it both at the `agent_auth` top level (parallel to `register_uri`)
 * and inside the `anonymous` method object so a validator that looks in either
 * location resolves it. See public/auth.md "## Claim".
 *
 * The Host is client-controlled, so the origin is derived through
 * `resolveMetadataOrigin` (apex + subdomain allowlist, apex fallback) so a
 * spoofed Host cannot be reflected into `issuer`/`token_endpoint`.
