# Yerküre MCP Server

Last updated: August 19, 2026

The Yerküre MCP Server exposes Yerküre's real-time global-intelligence stack over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), so any MCP-compatible client — Claude Desktop, Claude web, Cursor, MCP Inspector, or a custom agent — can pull live conflict, market, aviation, maritime, economic, cyber, and forecasting data directly into a model's context. It is the recommended way for AI agents to consume Yerküre data.

This persistent hosted server is distinct from [WorldMonitor WebMCP](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/webmcp), an experimental, page-local Chrome interface that operates the visible website. WebMCP does not replace the hosted MCP server; remote, background, headless, and direct-data agents should use the endpoint below.

## Endpoint

- **Server URL:** `https://worldmonitor.app/mcp` — Streamable HTTP transport, JSON-RPC 2.0 (JSON responses by default, SSE when the client advertises `text/event-stream`; `initialize` defaults to protocol `2025-03-26`). This is the only advertised product MCP server.
- **Aliases:** `www`, `api`, `tech`, `finance`, `commodity`, `happy`, and `energy` under `worldmonitor.app` are a client-migration surface, not extra installations. Ordinary GET/HEAD `/mcp` and `/api/mcp` redirect (308) to `https://worldmonitor.app/mcp`; ordinary GET/HEAD `/.well-known/mcp` and `/.well-known/mcp.json` redirect (308) to `https://worldmonitor.app/.well-known/mcp` and `https://worldmonitor.app/.well-known/mcp.json`. Query is not forwarded. Transport POST, SSE, and replay answer HTTP 410 with JSON-RPC `-32000` `Use https://worldmonitor.app/mcp`.
- **Server card:** https://worldmonitor.app/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json
- **Docs MCP server:** `https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/mcp` — a second, public (no-auth) MCP server with search-and-retrieval tools over the documentation. Route "how do I…" questions there; route live-data calls to the product server above.

Use the apex server URL for all product MCP clients. Product-host aliases return a canonical migration response; they do not provide a second MCP transport.

## Tools

The server ships tools covering world and country briefs, country risk and resilience, China decision signals, conflict events, markets, commodities, global procurement opportunities, energy, maritime and aviation activity, cyber threats, sanctions, natural disasters, health signals, prediction markets, and AI forecasts. Issue `tools/list` for the live inventory, `prompts/list` for pre-built workflow templates, and `resources/list` for read-only resources. `tools/list`, `prompts/list`, and `resources/list` are **public** — no key required. Every tool accepts an optional `jmespath` argument for [server-side projection](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/mcp-jmespath), typically an 80–95% response-size cut.

## MCP Apps

Yerküre supports MCP Apps (`io.modelcontextprotocol/ui`) with interactive `ui://` app shells. The linked tools are `get_country_risk`, `get_world_brief`, `get_country_brief`, `get_market_data`, `get_chokepoint_status`, `get_news_intelligence`, `get_conflict_events`, `get_natural_disasters`, `get_prediction_markets`, and `get_forecast_predictions`; their UI resources are:

- `ui://worldmonitor/country-risk.html`
- `ui://worldmonitor/world-brief.html`
- `ui://worldmonitor/country-brief.html`
- `ui://worldmonitor/market-radar.html`
- `ui://worldmonitor/chokepoint-monitor.html`
- `ui://worldmonitor/news-intelligence.html`
- `ui://worldmonitor/conflict-events.html`
- `ui://worldmonitor/natural-disasters.html`
- `ui://worldmonitor/prediction-markets.html`
- `ui://worldmonitor/forecasts.html`

Hosts discover the links through `_meta.ui.resourceUri` in `tools/list`, enumerate the shells through `resources/list`, and fetch each template with `resources/read`. `ui://` reads are public and quota-exempt because they return static, data-free HTML; live data still arrives through a normal authenticated `tools/call`. Full contract: [MCP Apps](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/mcp-apps).

## Authentication

- **Connecting an MCP client:** an `initialize` with no credentials gets `401` with a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge, which starts your client's OAuth sign-in. A free account is enough.
- **`tools/list` and other stateless discovery calls:** anonymous, no key.
- **`get_sources` via `tools/call`:** no credentials and no daily quota; separate fail-closed limit of 10 anonymous calls/minute/IP. Its `tools/list` and server-card entries carry `_meta["worldmonitor/access"]: "free"`.
- **All other data-bearing `tools/call` and `resources/read`:** need subscription access through an API key or OAuth.
  - **API key:** header `X-WorldMonitor-Key: wm_<40-hex>` — issue one at https://www.worldmonitor.app/pro. Per-minute burst is plan-resolved and shared per user across all of an account's keys and OAuth tokens: 60/minute on Pro, Pro Business and API Starter, 300 on API Business, 1,000 on Enterprise. Legacy operator-issued keys stay at a flat 60/minute/key.
  - **OAuth 2.1 (`scope=mcp`):** Pro and API tiers can both connect via OAuth with no API key. Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591) at `https://worldmonitor.app/oauth/register`; authorization and token endpoints follow OAuth 2.1 with PKCE. The daily allowance is plan-resolved and identical on both doors, so a dashboard-issued `wm_…` key gets the same budget as an OAuth token for the same account. Pro is 50 quota-consuming `tools/call` / `resources/read` calls per UTC day and Pro Business is 250, one unit per call on a dedicated MCP counter. API Starter is 1,000 units/day and API Business is 10,000, drawn from the same allowance as their REST requests and charged at a per-tool weight of 1 for a cache read, 2 for a live downstream fetch, 3 for `get_country_brief` and `get_airspace`. Enterprise can be unlimited. Quota-free metadata methods and `get_sources` do not reserve a daily slot.

## Connect in one step

```sh
# Confirm reachability with the public CLI (no key):
npx worldmonitor tools
```

Add the server to Claude Desktop / Cursor via their MCP settings using the URL `https://worldmonitor.app/mcp`, or follow the [MCP Quickstart](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/mcp-quickstart) for a five-minute path to a real tool call.
