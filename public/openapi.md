# Yerküre OpenAPI Specification

Last updated: July 7, 2026

The Yerküre OpenAPI Specification is the machine-readable contract for the Yerküre REST API — the HTTP surface that exposes the same real-time global-intelligence tools and data as the [MCP server](https://www.worldmonitor.app/mcp-server.md) via granular REST endpoints, returning source-attributed structured JSON. Point your OpenAPI client, code generator, or agent at the spec to discover every endpoint, parameter, and response shape.

## The spec

Yerküre publishes a REST API and MCP tools. It does not provide a GraphQL endpoint or GraphQL introspection. Use the OpenAPI documents below for the complete REST contract.

- **OpenAPI 3.1 (YAML):** https://www.worldmonitor.app/openapi.yaml
- **OpenAPI 3.1 (JSON):** https://www.worldmonitor.app/openapi.json
- **REST API base URL:** `https://api.worldmonitor.app`
- **Served Content-Type:** `application/yaml; charset=utf-8` (YAML) and `application/json; charset=utf-8` (JSON), both with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. The API catalog advertises the OpenAPI descriptor media type `application/vnd.oai.openapi` for the spec.

The spec is generated on every deploy from the canonical proto/service definitions, so it always matches the running gateway — there is no hand-maintained drift.

The YAML and JSON forms describe the same API: identical paths, operations, parameters, request bodies and responses. They are not byte-for-byte the same document. Agent-readiness scanners cap the body they will analyse near 1 MB, so the JSON is minified, collapses repeated structures into `$ref`s, and omits component schemas that no operation, response or parameter can reach. After that collapse, every JSON operation still keeps at least one inline typed parameter or requestBody so scanners that do not follow `components.parameters` `$ref`s still see typed input. Generate clients from either; use the YAML if you want every generated message type, including request messages that GET operations express as query parameters.

- **Commerce / pricing endpoints** live in a separate spec (kept out of the root bundle for size): https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/openapi/CommerceService.openapi.yaml
- **API catalog (RFC 9727):** https://worldmonitor.app/.well-known/api-catalog — a linkset that enumerates the REST API, MCP server, OpenAPI spec, pricing, support, and status surfaces.

## Authentication

Send the header `X-WorldMonitor-Key: wm_<40-hex>` on data calls (issue a key at https://www.worldmonitor.app/pro); discovery routes are public. Always send a descriptive `User-Agent` — the edge firewall challenges generic library agents (`curl/*`, `python-requests/*`), and a 403 means "retry with a real UA", not "endpoint missing". Rate limit: 60 requests/minute/key; honor `Retry-After` on 429. Full matrix: https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/usage-auth · walkthrough: [auth.md](https://www.worldmonitor.app/auth.md)

## Use it

```sh
# Generate a typed client from the spec:
npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \
  -i https://www.worldmonitor.app/openapi.yaml -g python -o ./wm-client
```

Or skip codegen entirely and use an [official SDK](https://www.worldmonitor.app/sdks.md) or the [CLI](https://www.worldmonitor.app/docs/cli).
